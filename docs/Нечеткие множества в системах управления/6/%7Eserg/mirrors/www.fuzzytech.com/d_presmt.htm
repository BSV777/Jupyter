<p align="center"><b>MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY AND INFORM ANNOUNCE
JOINT<br>
AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP FUZZY LOGIC FOR MCUs</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><i>Contact: Veronica Batchelor, Napier Partnership,
+44-243-513434</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>Microchip Technology Inc. of Chandler Arizona, and INFORM GmbH
of Aachen, Germany, today announced a strategic partnership
agreement to develop and market fuzzy logic development software
for Microchip's proprietary 8-bit microcontroller product line. </p>

<p>Microchip, a leader in the design of field-programmable
embedded control solutions, and INFORM, a master of fuzzy logic
technology, will apply their respective expertise to develop
complete, low-cost, easy-to-use fuzzy logic application
development tools for Microchip microcontrollers. The companies
will also combine efforts to market the technology to the design
community through worldwide technical presentations, design
seminars and application development. </p>

<p>&quot;Microchip's focus in the consumer, automotive and office
automation markets has clearly been elevated with the
opportunities presented by this partnership,&quot; explained Bill
Knauss, Microchip's Development Systems product marketing
manager. &quot;Fuzzy logic is a very powerful concept that is
gaining worldwide acceptance and has become a natural extension
of our already strong array of microcontroller development tools.
After evaluating other companies, Microchip saw INFORM as the
clear technology for this partnership. </p>

<p>INFORM, rapidly emerging as the international frontrunner in
fuzzy logic technology, regards the Microchip 8-bit
microcontroller, empowered with RISC architecture and highly
efficient development tools, as a perfect engine for faster
execution of fuzzy algorithms. </p>

<p>Microchip has made the embedded control market a priority, and
recognizing the market's huge growth potential, has established
itself as a successful industry leader,&quot; said Constantin von
Altrock, director of INFORM's Fuzzy Technologies Division.
&quot;We look forward to combining fuzzy logic with Microchip's
microcontroller technology.&quot; </p>

<p>Microchip Technology Inc. is the worldwide leader in the
design, manufacture and marketing of field-programmable
high-performance 8-bit RISC microcontrollers, complementary ASSP
products and related speciality memory products for high-volume
embedded control applications. Microchip addresses the growing
need for embedded control solutions in the consumer, automotive,
office automation, communications and industrial control markets
with prodúcts that feature both ROM-based technology and the
industry's most economical OTP capability. The company is located
outside Phoenix in Chandler, Arizona, where it operates a 0.9
micron wafer fabrication line, and has a wholly-owned subsidiary
performing assembly and test in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, as well as
sales offices in Europe, Asia, Japan and North America. Microchip
is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol MCHP. </p>

<p>INFORM GmbH develops and markets a variety of fuzzy logic
application tools, including <i>fuzzy</i>TECH, one of the
industry's leading software design tools. The company has been
involved in extensive research and development of fuzzy logic
technology for 24 years. INFORM's tools offer the design engineer
a graphic and object-oriented development environment and
automatically generate highly optimized processor-specific
assembly code or high-level (C) code. Company headquarters is
located in Aachen, Germany, with its U.S. sales and support
division located outside Chicago in Evanston, Illinois. </p>
