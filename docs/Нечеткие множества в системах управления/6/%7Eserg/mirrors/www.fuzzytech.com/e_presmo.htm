TOOLS FOR 68HC11 ABD 68HC12 FAMILIES</b></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Editorial Contact: Greg Evans, Cunningham Communication,
Inc., (512) 347-2305</em></p>

<hr>

<p>AUSTIN, Texas -- October 6, 1997 -- Today, Motorola's
Semiconductor Products Sector and Inform Software Corp. announced
the availability of new fuzzy logic development tools for the
8-bit 68HC11 and 16-bit 68HC12 microcontroller families that can
simplify programming, reduce code size and allow code to execute
faster. The 68HC12 is the first general purpose microcontroller
family with dedicated fuzzy logic instructions.</p>

<p>Developed with Inform Software Corp., the leading fuzzy logic
technology developer, these new tools ease the development of
customer's Motorola microcontroller-based products which utilize
fuzzy logic. The two companies will also combine efforts to
educate the design community regarding the benefits of fuzzy
logic technology.</p>

<p>&quot;Inform is the leading supplier for fuzzy logic
development tools,&quot; said Greg White, general manager of
Motorola's Safety &amp; Chassis Systems Division. &quot;We are
excited to work with them to offer the best fuzzy logic
development tools for the 68HC11 and 68HC12 microcontroller
families.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Motorola's 68HC12 is the first standard microcontroller
family with a comprehensive fuzzy logic instruction set and, as
such, is the premier 16-bit engine for executing fuzzy
logic,&quot; said Constantin von Altrock, director of Inform's
Fuzzy Technologies Division. &quot;Motorola delivers what
customers using fuzzy logic need: the performance of dedicated
fuzzy hardware solutions at the price of a standard
microcontroller.&quot;</p>

<p>Inform has added support of the 68HC11 and 68HC12 families to
their <em>fuzzy</em>TECH product line. It provides complete fuzzy
logic design software for all 68HC11 and 68HC12 derivatives. <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
lets users design solutions based on standardized development
methodology in very short time. At the push of a button, <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
generates the fuzzy logic system as assembly code for the target
microcontroller.</p>

<p>The unique performance/price ratio achieved by the 68HC12
executing fuzzy logic will enable new and innovative solutions in
many different application areas. In hard disk design, the fuzzy
logic instructions on the 68HC12 speed track-to-track seek times.
In automotive applications, the 68HC12's fuzzy logic instructions
will be used to make conventional anti-lock braking systems
adaptive to the road surface, and to design ignition systems that
deliver higher fuel efficiency. And, in telecommunications
applications, fuzzy logic instructions on the 68HC12 will enable
the implementation of intelligent systems for routing, cell
switching, and voice compression.</p>

<p>On the 68HC11, <em>fuzzy</em>TECH emulates the entire fuzzy
logic algorithm in software, while the code generated for the
68HC12 utilizes its special fuzzy logic instructions.</p>

<p>Together, Motorola and Inform have co-developed a low-cost
version called <em>fuzzy</em>TECH HC11/12 Explorer. It offers the
same functionality as <em>fuzzy</em>TECH MCU-HC11/12 Edition, but
allows only developing small fuzzy logic systems.</p>

<p><strong>About Inform Software Corp.</strong></p>

<p>Inform Software Corp. develops and markets a variety of fuzzy
logic and neural-fuzzy application tools, including the <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
development system, one of the industry's leading software design
tools. The company has been involved in extensive research and
development of fuzzy logic technology for 20 years. The company
is headquartered in Aachen, Germany, with its U.S. sales and
support division located in Oak Brook, Illinois.</p>

<p><strong>About Motorola</strong></p>

<p>Motorola offers over 250 different 8-, 16- and 32-bit
microcontrollers in its portfolio and has been the number one
supplier of microcontrollers for four years running (source:
In-Stat, Dataquest).</p>

<p>With 1996 worldwide sales of $7.9 billion, Motorola's
Semiconductor Products Sector is the largest U.S.-based broad
line supplier of semiconductor solutions. Motorola is one of the
world's leading providers of wireless communications,
semiconductors, advanced electronic systems, components and
services. Major equipment businesses include cellular telephone,
two-way radio, paging and data communications, personal
communications, automotive, defense and space electronics, and
computers. Motorola semiconductors power communication devices,
computers and millions of other products. Motorola Inc.'s 1996
sales were $28 billion.</p>

<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Fuzzy Logic</strong></p>

<p>A very reliable programming methodology, fuzzy logic also
offers the benefits of simplicity, small code size, and reduced
memory requirements. It allows the control of real-world systems
using elements of natural language rather than rigorous
mathematical modeling, thus simplifying programming. Fuzzy logic
uses plain language rules and knowledge directly from the
application expert rather than forcing the expert to translate
knowledge into a computer programming language.</p>

<p>Overall, fuzzy logic needs far less memory than table-based
control and, in many cases, math-based control. Fuzzy systems may
use one tenth as many rules as conventional systems. Fuzzy logic
reduces complexity of problems allowing simple controllers to
handle complex problems or more advanced controllers to perform
more quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of </strong><em><strong>fuzzy</strong></em><strong>TECH</strong></p>

<p><em>fuzzy</em>TECH's support of a system using fuzzy logic
does not stop with code generation. Rather, <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
allows to monitor and modify the fuzzy logic system after
implementation in real-time on the running microcontroller. Users
can thus analyze the behavior of a fuzzy logic controller in real
situations and optimize a running system &quot;on-the-fly.&quot;
In contrast to an in-circuit emulator, the running system is not
even halted for modification of the fuzzy logic control strategy.
Only a serial connection between <em>fuzzy</em>TECH and the
microcontroller is required for this, no special hardware is
needed. In addition to the serial interface, <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
also supports the special Background Debug&trade; Mode interface
of the 68HC12 for &quot;on-the-fly&quot; optimization.</p>

<p>Because <em>fuzzy</em>TECH analyzes the fuzzy logic system
structure thoroughly when generating the microcontroller code, it
can generate faster and more compact fuzzy logic systems than
manual coding can. Even complex fuzzy logic systems compute in
less than one millisecond and require less than one Kbyte of ROM
space on the 68HC11. Because of the special fuzzy logic functions
available on the 68HC12, implemented fuzzy logic systems will run
about 15 times faster and are six times more compact than on the
68HC11.</p>

<p>Inform also offers a <em>fuzzy</em>TECH edition that supports
generation of portable C code on Motorola 68HC16, 68x00, and
PowerPC families. Future releases of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH will
support the 68HC05 and 68HC08 families of microcontrollers. </p>
