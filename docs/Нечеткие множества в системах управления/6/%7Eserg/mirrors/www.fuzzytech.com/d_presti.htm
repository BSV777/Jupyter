<p align="center"><b>TI AND INFORM ANNOUNCE FIRST FUZZY LOGIC
TOOLS<br>
FOR DSP-BASED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><i>Contact: Donna Coletti, (713) 274-3361</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>HOUSTON (Jan. 19, 1994)-- Designers of digital signal
processing (DSP)-based systems will now be able to implement
fuzzy logic techniques because of new software available from
Texas Instruments and Inform Software Corporation. Fuzzy logic,
when used in DSP-based applications, merges human understanding
with traditional control techniques by using elements of everyday
language to represent desired system behavior. This circumvents
the need for rigorous mathematical modeling. More intelligent
control, in addition to increased performance, can be
incorporated into products ranging from hard disk drives to
motors to radar and sonar systems. These products are easier to
use because certain functions can now be automated for the first
time. </p>

<p><b>TMS320</b> <b><i>fuzzy</i></b><b>TECH Tools</b> </p>

<p>The new TMS320 <i>fuzzy</i>TECH logic tools include <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
MCU-320 Edition and <i>fuzzy</i>TECH MCU-320 Explorer. The <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
MCU-320 Edition is the first complete software development
environment for fuzzy logic systems implementing DSPs. The <i>fuzzy</i>TECHMCU-320
Explorer is a fuzzy logic system design training tool based on
MS-Windows&trade;. Both are designed for use with TI TMS320C2x
and TMS320C5x generation DSPs. </p>

<p>The <i>fuzzy</i>TECH MCU-320 Edition generates portable C code
and optimized assembly code providing designers with easy
integration to conventional code. Graphical tools are provided
for all development steps including design, optimization and
verification. At the push of a button, the built-in code
generator outputs the entire fuzzy system optimized for the
selected TI `C2x or `C5x DSP. </p>

<p>The fuzzyTECH MCU-320 Edition is compatible with a traditional
fuzzy design flow and all other non-TMS320 versions of fuzzyTECH.
System designs are represented in fuzzy technology language,
making designs hardware independent. This independence provides
users flexibility in determining system configurations and the
processors necessary to meet system performance requirements. The <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
MCU-320 Explorer is a computer-assisted training software program
that teaches the design steps of fuzzy logic-based systems. </p>

<p><b>Fuzzy Logic as a Control Technique</b> </p>

<p>Fuzzy logic offers an alternative solution to conventional
control techniques. Because DSPs are architecturally optimized
for mathematically-intensive tasks, a single DSP can accomplish
both signal processing functions, such as filtering and signal
estimation, as well as performing control tasks using either
conventional control techniques using proportional integrated
differential and/or fuzzy logic. The <i>fuzzy</i>TECH tools will
have the most significance in the high-performance arena,
including compression applications involving video and voice,
applications requiring very fast control, such as in hard disk
drives and motors, and signal analysis applications in equipment,
such as radar and sonar. </p>

<p>&quot;Fuzzy logic has been proven to be a successful
technology in both Europe and Japan in a board range of
applications ranging from appliances and automotive systems to
industrial automatization and signal processing,&quot; said
Constantin von Altrock, director of the Fuzzy Technologies
Division at Inform. &quot;By using fuzzy logic, these products
have been designed in less time, yielding more functionality and
higher performance.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Our benchmark shows that TMS320 DSPs, when implementing
fuzzy logic, provide ten times the performance over a comparably
priced conventional 16-bit microcontroller,&quot; said Dr.
Kun-Shan Lin, TI´s DSP marketing manager. &quot;Similar
performance levels have also been obtained in comparisons with
hardwired fuzzy chips, which do not have the inherent flexibility
of a programmable DSP. Now, non-DSP users have an option which
delivers flexible, improved performance for next generation
designs.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Availability</b> </p>

<p>The TMS320 <i>fuzzy</i>TECH logic tools are currently
available in beta versions from TI. Production availability is
planned for early December from TI, Inform and authorized
distributors. Suggested retail price for the <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
MCU-320 Edition is $1,890. Suggested retail price for the <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
MCU-320 Explorer is $199. </p>

<p>The TMS320 DSP family has led the industry since TI introduced
ist first member in 1982. Today, the TMS320 family is the most
widely used family of single-chip DSPs and includes five
generations of more than 30 compatible devices, providing
designers with both fixed- and floating-point devices to fit a
variety of price/performance requirements. Applications range
from consumer products to telecommunications switching equipment
to high-reliability military applications to active suspension in
automobiles. </p>

<p>Inform Software Corporation of Illinois and INFORM GmbH of
Germany have been involved in extensive research and development
of fuzzy technologies for over a decade years. Inform has
developed a variety of fuzzy industrial applications worldwide
over the years and brings a wealth of real-world expertise to the
design of its <i>fuzzy</i>TECH tools and embedded designs. </p>

<p>Texas Instruments Semiconductor Group has combined a breadth
of silicon technologies, hardware and software development tools,
design information services and worldwide support to help ist
customers move to their next level of integration faster and with
better systems. TI`s Total Integration&trade; capabilities
attract teacher-costumers from around the world giving TI system
expertise to enable differentiation of its costumers' products in
key end equipment market segments, including computer,
communications, consumer electronics, automotive, military and
industrial. </p>

<p>Texas Instruments Incorporated, headquartered in Dallas, is a
high-technology company with sales or manufacturing operations in
more than 30 countries. TI products and services include
semiconductors; defense electronics systems; software
productivity tools; printers, notebook computers and consumer
electronics products; custom engineering and manufacturing
services; electrical controls; and metallurgical materials. </p>
