<p><font size="2" face="arial">To compare the computing performance of different hardware
platforms in all areas of computing, performance measures -- so-called
&quot;benchmarks&quot; -- are used. For fuzzy logic systems, measures such as MFLIPS
(million fuzzy logic inferences per second) and others have been proposed in the past.
However, it has become apparent that these performance measures are of limited practical
value. An MFLIPS number for example does not satisfactorily answer the question of how
much computing time a specific fuzzy logic system requires on a certain hardware platform.
Since many different definitions exist for what &quot;a fuzzy logic inference&quot; is and
what computational steps it comprises, some vendors went as far as only counting a single
multiplication or minimum computation as &quot;a fuzzy logic inference&quot;. Furthermore,
in some fuzzy logic systems, fuzzification and defuzzification can require significantly
more computation time than the rule inference. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">To create a more practical performance measure, a set of
&quot;typical fuzzy logic systems&quot; that spans the entire range from simple to complex
and is representative of various application areas has been defined by an Industry
consortium and is currently proposed as standard bechmark suite for fuzzy logic systems in
the IEEE Standing Committee on Standards. Members of the Industry consortium comprise
companies such as <a href="e_inform.htm">Inform</a>, <a href="e_partnr.htm#intel">Intel</a>,
<a href="e_partnr.htm#km">Klockner-Moeller</a>, <a href="e_partnr.htm#mti">Microchip</a>, <a
href="e_partnr.htm#mot">Motorola</a>, <a href="e_partnr.htm#ab">Rockwell</a>, <a
href="e_partnr.htm#siemens">Siemens Semiconductor</a> (alphabetic order). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The proposed set of benchmarks allows for the comparison of
computing time and code space requirements for &quot;typical fuzzy logic systems&quot; of
different sizes and application area. Practitioners seeking a ballpark estimation of the
computing resources required to process their fuzzy logic solution can identify the fuzzy
logic system closest to their application from the benchmark suite. Total computation time
and required code size of &quot;typical fuzzy logic systems&quot; then becomes a
meaningful measure to compare the performance of different hardware platforms. To ensure
that benchmark results lead to fair comparisons, definition of the test procedure is also
necessary (resolutions, input patterns, etc..). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The complete set of benchmarks is provided as FTL source
code with every Edition of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH. You find the FTL files in the subdirectory
..\SAMPLES\BENCHxx on your <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Installation CD ROM. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">You may use the set of five (5) fuzzy logic standard
benchmark files (FuzMarks) under the following conditions:</font><font size="2"> </font>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="arial">If you publish benchmarks based on FuzMarks, you have to
    provide the following information for the test: device specifications (including clock
    speed, type of memory access,..), maximum and average computation speed for the entire
    fuzzy logic benchmark system tested for a 10% resolution pattern input, memory (RAM and
    ROM), as well as register memory requirements, compiler (if used).</font><font size="2"> </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="arial">If you publish benchmarks based on FuzMarks, you must
    include the definition of the benchmarks as well as the copyright. You must also provide
    us with a copy of the publication. </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="arial">You may not distribute the FuzMarks set of benchmarks.
    However, you can reference the download location in all your publications. </font></li>
