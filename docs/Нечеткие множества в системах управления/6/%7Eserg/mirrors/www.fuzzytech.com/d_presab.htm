<p align="center"><b>FUZZY LOGIC SOFTWARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR <br>
ALLEN-BRADLEY CONTROL COPROCESSOR </b></p>

<hr>

<p><i>Contact: Mike Moore, Allen-Bradley Company, Inc., (216)
646-3094</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>DETROIT, April 11, 1994 - One of the world's leading fuzzy
logic software tools from Inform Software Corporation is now
available for Allen-Bradley Control Coprocessor applications. </p>

<p>Inform's <i>fuzzy</i>TECH<sup>®</sup> is an object-oriented
user interface that supports all design steps for fuzzy system
engineering. <i>fuzzy</i>TECH provides a front- end graphical
interface for program development and process optimization, while
at the same time, automatically generating the intelligent code
for the Control Coprocessor. In addition, <i>fuzzy</i>TECH also
features real-time visualization capabilities to optimize a
running system &quot;on-the-fly.&quot; Adaptive system design is
supported by <i>fuzzy</i>TECH's NeuroFuzzy software that
integrates neural network technologies. </p>

<p>Industrial automation leader Allen-Bradley Company, Inc., a
Rockwell Automation business, announced that <i>fuzzy</i>TECH has
been chosen as a selected product in its Pyramid Solutions
Program. This program is dedicated to finding leading hardware
and software products which help add customer value to
Allen-Bradley automation control systems. </p>

<p>&quot;With <i>fuzzy</i>TECH now available for the
Allen-Bradley Control Coprocessor, users have another major
software tool to help provide control process application
solutions in new and stronger ways,&quot; said Amy Archer,
Control Coprocessor product manager. Currently, the Control
Coprocessor runs programs in C, BASIC, and assembler languages in
real-time multitasking operating system environments. </p>

<p>Archer said that users will want to use <i>fuzzy</i>TECH in a
number of analog- based process applications. <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
fine tunes a process based on the user's application expertise
versus mathematical or control algorithm modeling. A system is
Configured by descriptive rules rather than by algebraic
equations. </p>

<p>She said that this object-oriented interface is extremely easy
to learn and exceptionally good at solving process oriented
analog-based applications. The standard software tool, <i>fuzzy</i>TECH,
has been created by Inform, a company with 24 years experience in
fuzzy logic research and application. Inform is a market leading
company in these technologies. Inform's technical teams have
served as consultants on many successful fuzzy logic applications
worldwide. </p>

<p>Constantin von Altrock, director of Inform's fuzzy
technologies division, said, &quot;Due to the flexibility and
computing power of PLC-5<sup>®</sup> programmable controller and
its Control Coprocessor, even large fuzzy logic systems can be
computed in milliseconds.&quot; </p>

<p>Allen-Bradley, a Rockwell Automation business, is a worldwide
leader in the manufacture and sale of industrial automation
controls and systems. Allen-Bradley has its world headquarters in
Milwaukee, Wis. Rockwell is a diversified, high technology
company holding leadership positions in automation, avionics,
aerospace, defense electronics, telecommunications, automotive
components and graphic systems, with annual worldwide sales of
$11 billion. </p>
