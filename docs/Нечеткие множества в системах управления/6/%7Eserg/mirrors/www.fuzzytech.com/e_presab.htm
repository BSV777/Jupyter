<center><b>FUZZY LOGIC SOFTWARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR <br>
ALLEN-BRADLEY CONTROL COPROCESSOR </p></b></center>
<hr>

<p>
<i>Contact: Mike Moore, Allen-Bradley Company, Inc., (216) 646-3094</p></i>

<p>
DETROIT, April 11, 1994 - One of the world's leading fuzzy logic
software tools from Inform Software Corporation is now available
for Allen-Bradley Control Coprocessor applications. </p>
<p>
Inform's <i>fuzzy</i>TECH<sup>&reg;</sup> is an object-oriented
user interface that supports all design steps for fuzzy system
engineering. <i>fuzzy</i>TECH provides a front-end graphical interface
for program development and process optimization, while at the
same time automatically generating the intelligent code for the
Control Coprocessor. In addition, <i>fuzzy</i>TECH also features
real-time visualization capabilities to optimize a running system
&quot;on-the-fly.&quot; Adaptive system design is supported by
<i>fuzzy</i>TECH's NeuroFuzzy software that integrates neural
network technologies. </p>
<p>
Industrial automation leader Allen-Bradley Company, Inc., a Rockwell
Automation business, announced that <i>fuzzy</i>TECH has been
chosen as a selected product in its Pyramid Solutions Program.
This program is dedicated to finding leading hardware and software
products which help add customer value to Allen-Bradley automation
control systems. </p>
<p>
&quot;With <i>fuzzy</i>TECH now available for the Allen-Bradley
Control Coprocessor, users have another major software tool to
help provide control process application solutions in new and
stronger ways,&quot; said Amy Archer, Control Coprocessor Product
Manager. Currently, the Control Coprocessor runs programs in C,
BASIC, and assembler languages in real-time multitasking operating
system environments. </p>
<p>
Archer said that users will want to use <i>fuzzy</i>TECH in a
number of analog-based process applications. <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
fine tunes a process based on the user's application expertise
versus mathematical or control algorithm modeling. A system is
configured by descriptive rules rather than by algebraic equations.</p>
<p>
She said that this object-oriented interface is extremely easy
to learn and exceptionally good at solving process oriented analog-based
applications. The standard software tool, <i>fuzzy</i>TECH, has
been created by Inform, a company with 24 years experience in
fuzzy logic research and application. Inform is a market leading
company in these technologies. Inform's technical teams have served
as consultants on many successful fuzzy logic applications worldwide.</p>
<p>
Constantin von Altrock, Director of Inform's Fuzzy Technologies
Division, said, &quot;Due to the flexibility and computing power
of the PLC-5<sup>&reg;</sup> programmable controller and its Control
Coprocessor, even large fuzzy logic systems can be computed in
milliseconds.&quot; </p>
<p>
Allen-Bradley, a Rockwell Automation business, is a worldwide
leader in the manufacture and sale of industrial automation controls
and systems. Allen-Bradley has its world headquarters in Milwaukee,
Wis. Rockwell is a diversified, high technology company holding
leadership positions in automation, avionics, aerospace, defense
electronics, telecommunications, automotive components and graphic
systems, with annual worldwide sales of $11 billion. </p>
