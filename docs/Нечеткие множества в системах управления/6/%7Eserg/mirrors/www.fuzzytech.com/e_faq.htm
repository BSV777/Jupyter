<p><font size="2" face="arial">This page collects some of the frequently asked questions
about <i>fuzzy</i>TECH and explains some of the <a href="#terminology">Terminology</a>
used on this web server. If you do not find the answer to your question here, please send

What Can Fuzzy Logic Contribute to My Design?</b></font><font size="2"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><em>The World is Fuzzy: </em>The flexibility that lies in
the words and statements we employ is widely used in society. In most western societies,
the legal system consists of a certain number of laws, each of which describes a different
situation. For example, one law could express that theft of a car should be punished with
two years of prison. Another law could define diminished responsibility. In one case in
court, the judge must decide the exact number of days in prison for a thief who stole a
car while under the influence with a blood alcohol level of 0.1%, who had a bad childhood,
and was left by his spouse the day before. As a specific law does not exists for each
case, the judge has to combine all applicable laws to derive a fair decision. This is only
possible due to the flexibility in the definition of the words and statements used in each
law.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="why"><img src="ft16x16.gif" width="16" height="16"></a><b>
What Hardware Do I Need to Run <i>fuzzy</i>TECH? </b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In most technical applications, one hardware platform
(development computer) is used for the developing the fuzzy logic system while a different
hardware platform (target hardware) is used to run the fuzzy logic system later. <i>fuzzy</i>TECH's
user interface, that is all the graphical components you find explained on the pages of
this web server, only runs on a PC. The release 4.2x runs under MS-Windows 3.1x,
MS-Windows95, MS-Windows/NT 3.51 or 4.0, and the Windows emulation of OS/2. The release
5.0 runs under MS-Windows95 and MS-Windows/NT 4.0. Minimum hardware is a 486-class PC with
8 MB RAM, and VGA graphics. For complex system design we recommend a Pentium-class PC with
a resolution of 800x600 (or more) and 256 colors. Although <i>fuzzy</i>TECH can be used
entirely with the keyboard, a mouse or a similar pointing device is highly recommended. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">While the development computer always must be a PC with a
MS-Windows operating system, <i>fuzzy</i>TECH supports a wide range of target hardware
platforms: the MCU Editions generate fuzzy logic systems as assembly code, the IA Editions
are delivered with special fuzzy logic function blocks, and the Professional/Online
Editions generate portable C code. An overview of the different target platforms can be
found below. </font></p>

<p><a name="dde"><font size="2" face="arial"><strong>DDE</strong> := Dynamic Data
Exchange, a technology that allows two software programs under MS-Windows to exchange
data. <em>fuzzy</em>TECH supports a DDE intearface.</font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="dll"><strong>DLL</strong> := Dynamic Link Library,
a file containing functions that can be called by a program. <em>fuzzy</em>TECH uses DLLs
internally to structure its code modules, but also provides DLLs as interfaces to other
software programs, </a>e.g. the FTRUN.DLL and FTRCU.DLL. The<a name="dll"> FTRCU.DLL DLL
contains functions that you can use to embed the complete user interface of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
in your own code or other software packages, and the FTRUN.DLL contains functions that let
you compute any <em>fuzzy</em>TECH generated system.</a></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="dos"><strong>DoS</strong> :</a> = Degree of
Support (in fuzzy rules). Adding an individual weight to each rule extends the concept of
&quot;on/off&quot; rules to a representation where rules themselves are &quot;fuzzy&quot;.
This allows for the rule base to be fine tuned during optimization. Since the mapping of
the input of the rules to the output now itself is fuzzy, this concept is often referred
to as a &quot;Fuzzy Associative Map&quot; <a href="#fam">(FAM</a>). The tuning parameter
is called &quot;Degree of Support&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="fam"><strong>FAM</strong></a> : = Fuzzy
Associative Map; see <a href="#dos">DoS</a>.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="ftl"><strong>FTL</strong></a>: = Fuzzy Technology
Language, a file format for fuzzy logic systems supported by most software and hardware
vendors of fuzzy logic solutions. Developed by Intel Corp. and Inform Software Corp. in
1991, FTL allows for the exchange of fuzzy logic systems between different software and
hardware tools and platforms. All <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Editions store their projects as FTL
files. FTL is an ASCII description language and can thus be read and edited using any text
editor.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="ftr"><strong>FTR</strong></a>: = <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
Runtime, a file format generated by <em>fuzzy</em>TECH for its runtime module. A FTR file
is a binary data representation of a fuzzy logic system. Depending on the options used, a
FTR file can even contain all the necessary information for fuzzyTECH to reconstruct an
entire<a href="#ftl"> FTL</a> file from it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="ftrcu"><strong>FTRCU</strong>:</a> = (<em>fuzzy</em>Tech
Remote Control Unit), an interface that allows you to tie in the complete <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
development system in other software programs. In every <em>fuzzy</em>TECH installation
from release 5.0 on, this file is located in the installation directory of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
and can be used by any other program to &quot;remote control&quot; <em>fuzzy</em>TECH. For
example, all three simulations of the <em>fuzzy</em>TECH 5.0 Demo use this interface to
start <em>fuzzy</em>TECH remotely, open the appropriate fuzzy logic system, and let <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
compute the output values of the fuzzy logic system under simulation. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="ftrun"><strong>FTRUN</strong></a>: = (<em>fuzzy</em>Tech
RUNtime Module), an interface that only integrates the runtime kernel of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
with other software programs. FTRUN is available as 16-bit DLL (FTRUN.DLL) and 32-bit DLL
(FTRUN32.DLL) available with release 5.0 of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH. The files are
automatically placed in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ subdirectory by the setup routine of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH.
FTRUN can only open fuzzy logic systems in the <a href="#ftr">*.FTR</a> format. For more
information, please refer to the <a href="e_tc_lst.htm#1">technical note</a> about FTRUN.
The advantages of FTRUN over <a href="#ftrcu">FTRCU </a>are the fact that it's
royalty-free, its much smaller file size, and the much higher execution speed. FTRUN is
available only with the <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Professional and Online Edition. Monitoring of
fuzzy logic system that are computed by FTRUN is also possible with the <a
href="e_demo.htm"><em>fuzzy</em>TECH Demo</a> and <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Viewer release 5.0+.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><strong><em>fuzzy</em>TECH Viewer</strong>: = The <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
Online Edition is delivered with the <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Viewer, a version of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
that can visualize any fuzzy logic system that is computed by the Runtime Module. The <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
Online Edition licence comprises the distribution licence of the <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
Viewer, thus you may include the <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Viewer with any of your generated
fuzzy logic systems freely if you are a <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Online Edition user.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><strong>IPX/SPX Protocol</strong>: = The Internetwork
Packet Exchange / Synchron Package Exchange protocol is a netware protocol that can be
used for data exchange via a certain type of netware (e.g. Novell Netware/Intranetware).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><a name="online"><strong>Online Debugging</strong></a>:=
The &quot;Online&quot; debugging technique allows for the modification of a running fuzzy
logic system &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. In Online Debug Mode, all editors and analyzers of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
let you monitor the fuzzy logic inference in real time and every modification is
implemented instantly on the target hardware. <em>fuzzy</em>TECH communicates
bi-directionally with the target system at any time via a serial cable, a shared network
file system (<a href="#sfs">SFS</a>), or another communication link. The real-time data is
transferred from the target hardware to the graphical editors and analyzers of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH,
allowing complete visualization of the fuzzy logic inference. Any modification to the
fuzzy logic system is transferred from <em>fuzzy</em>TECH to the target hardware and
implemented without halting this system. Remote traces can be configured and controlled
from <em>fuzzy</em>TECH as well.</font></p>

<p><a name="ole_olx"><font size="2" face="arial"><strong>OLE/OLX</strong>: = Object
Linking and Embedding, a technology for embedding one software system into another, now
called ActiveX. The <em>fuzzy</em>TECH runtime module is available as an OLE module that
can be integrated with all other software packages supporting OLE/OLX/ActiveX.</font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><strong>PLC</strong>: = Programmable Logic Controllers.
These controllers are programmable and have integrated digital and analog I/O modules.They
are used in industrial automation, in an harsh industrial environment.</font></p>

<p><a name="rtf"><font size="2" face="arial"><strong>RTF</strong>: = Rich Text Format, a
file format for documents supported by most word processing software, such as MS-Word,
MS-Wordpad (comes with Windows95), WordPerfect, WordPro, and StarWriter. The documentation
generator of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH uses RTF to output documents. </font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><strong><a name="rtrcd">RTRCD</a> Debugging</strong>:= Some
<em>fuzzy</em>TECH MCU Editions also provide a limited <a href="#online">Online debugging</a>
functionality, called RTRCD (Real-Time Remote Cross Debugging). RTRCD lets you modify
rules and membership functions on-the-fly and run traces.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><strong><a name="sfs">SFS</a>: = </strong>Shared File
System (SFS). A SFS is a directory that can be accessed by two software programs. This
directory can be located on a PC (i.e. C:\TEMP) if both programs (e.g. <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
and the Runtime Module) run on the same PC. If <em>fuzzy</em>TECH and the Runtime Module
run on different PCs, this directory must either be located on a network server or on one
of the PCs as a shared directory. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><strong><a name="windows activex">Windows ActiveX</a>: = </strong>Windows
ActiveX is a technology to embed one software system into another. This technology was
