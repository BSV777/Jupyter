<p><font size="2" face="arial">Many groups in different countries
have worked on the standardization of fuzzy logic. An example of
such an activity is described in a paper </font><a
href="e_ap_lst.htm#11"><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Towards
Fuzzy Logic Standardization&quot;</font></a><font size="2"
face="arial">. One of the standardization activities has already
resulted in an upcoming international standard with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as an extension
of the existing IEC 1131 standard. This standard defines devices
used for industrial automation from mechanical parameters to
programming and documentation. Its third section (IEC 1131-3)
defines 5 programming languages for industrial automation
devices. Originally developed as a product standard for
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), the 5 programming languages
became widely accepted as programming languages for any type of
industrial automation and process control application. In July
1993, the Industrial-Process Measurement and Control
Sub-Committee No. 65B of the IEC has issues a new work item
proposal for fuzzy logic as extension of the existing standard
IEC 1131. The new section of this standard, IEC 1131-7, defines
fuzzy logic components for industrial automation and process
control. Because this standard is the world's first standard for
fuzzy logic design, we expect this standard to also influence all
other application areas of fuzzy logic. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">We have been involved in this IEC
standardization effort right from the beginning. This has ensured
that all <em>fuzzy</em>TECH Editions closely follow the
definitions, development procedures, and algorithms set forth in
the standard. If there will be any future changes in the
standard, we will have made the necessary changes in <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
even before the standard becomes public. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The current official status of the
IEC 1131-7 standard is &quot;Committee Draft&quot;, and the
current version of the document can be viewed as PDF file:</font></p>

not the final version of the standard. We will make the final
version of the standard available at this location when the
voting procedure of the IEC has approved the standard (status of
September 1997).</font></p>
