<h3><font size="2" face="arial">New Functions in Release 5.1 over
Release 5.0: </font></h3>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Release 5.1 features a major
        redesign of its user interface. The LV window (list of
        all linguistic variables) has been replaced by a powerful
        &quot;</font><a href="treview.gif"><font size="2"
        face="arial">treeview</font></a><font size="2"
        face="arial">&quot; window. This treeview displays a
        complete <em>fuzzy</em>TECH project as a structure
        similar to the Windows Explorer featured with
        MS-Windows'95 and /NT 4.0. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Throughout <em>fuzzy</em>TECH,
        many dialogs have been restructured and merged with
        others into tabbed dialogs for easier access.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">The DDE link capabilities of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
        have been modified to a simple &quot;cut&amp;paste&quot;
        approach similar to MS-Office software products, such as
        MS-Excel. For an example, see the </font><a
        href="ft-dde.gif"><font size="2" face="arial">screenshot</font></a><font
        size="2" face="arial">.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">The Trace function has been
        redesigned and its features have been extended. You may
        now conduct traces both remotely on the target hardware
        as well as locally on the PC.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">The Pattern Generator has
        been redesigned for easier and quicker use.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">The Debug window has been
        extended and enhanced. It is now called &quot;Watch&quot;
        window.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">New setup routine using
        InstallShield: We have created a completely new setup
        routine that lets you simultaneously install multiple
        Editions of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH into the same directory on
        your PC in one step.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">In <em>fuzzy</em>TECH, you
        may now switch &quot;life&quot; between all the Editions
        of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH you have installed. Simply select
        the Edition you want to work with from the Edition option
        of the Tools menu.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">You may now install any
        Edition of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH as Demo version. Thus,
        there is no dedicated &quot;Demo&quot; of <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
        anymore; every <em>fuzzy</em>TECH product falls back into
        Demo mode, if you do not have the license for it.</font></li>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">2</font><a name="relpol"><font
size="3" face="arial">. <i>fuzzy</i>TECH Release Policy </font></a></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The release number of every
software product of the <i>fuzzy</i>TECH family contains three
digits (for example: 4.23). The first digit, left of the decimal
point, is the <strong>major release number</strong> (generation
number). A change to this first digit indicates that the sofware
has undergone significant modifications which affect most
components. Major releases are issued at approximately one to two
year intervals. The first digit to the right of the decimal point
is the <strong>minor version number</strong>. A change to this
number indicates that minor modifications or enhancements have
been made to the software. Typical examples for such minor
changes include new components or additional target platform
support. In other words, changes that do not affect a great
number of the software components. A change to the second digit
to the right of the decimal point indicates a </font><a
name="mainrel"><font size="2" face="arial"><strong>maintenance
release</strong></font></a><font size="2" face="arial">. This
number is changed each time a new build to the entire product
range is made. These changes are typically not visible to the
user, involving bug fixes and resolving conflicts with other
software/hardware components (although we try hard to deliver
highly stable software products and invest heavily in quality
control, the state of the art in software design does not allow
for 100%-never-fail-software). Because maintenance releases do
not involve changes in functionality, the <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
release numbers cited in most of our documentation refers only to
the major release and minor version numbers.</font><font size="2">
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">If you have a <strong>software
update contract</strong>, you are automatically sent a new
release of your products for every major and minor release as
they become available. Major release updates include a new set of
manuals while minor releases come with short descriptions of the
new features and modifications. If you purchase software products
or updates from INFORM, you will always get the latest available
release with the latest available documentation. Note, the
release numbers of all add-on modules (NeuroFuzzy, FuzzyCluster,
RTRCD, ...) must match those of the <i>fuzzy</i>TECH Edition with
which they are supposed to run. Hence, add-on modules must always
be updated with the respective <i>fuzzy</i>TECH Edition.</font></p>

<h3><a name="main"><font size="3" face="arial">3. Maintenance
Updates</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">We now make updates to new
maintenance releases available for free to every <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
user. For example, if you have licensed <em>fuzzy</em>TECH
Professional release 5.1, then you are entitled to receive a free
update to the latest manitenance release available. For example,
if we have delivered release 5.10 to you, you may download and
install maintenance releases 5.11, 5.12, 5.13, ...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">To check the release number of the
latest available maintenance release, and to download&amp;install
it, please refer to the </font><a href="e_demo.htm#r51"><font

maintenance releases are only available from this web sites for
releases later than 5.10. </font></p>
