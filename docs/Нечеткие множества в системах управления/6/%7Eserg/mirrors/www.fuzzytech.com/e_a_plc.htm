<h1><font size="5" face="arial">Recent Successful Fuzzy Logic
Applications in Industrial Automation </font></h1>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><i>by Dr. Jörg Gebhardt and
Constantin von Altrock </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">Citation Reference: This paper was
been published at the Fifth IEEE International Conference on
Fuzzy Systems, held in New Orleans September 1996. The Fuzzy
Logic Application Note series is published by Inform Software

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><em>In this paper, we review eight
(8) recent applications of fuzzy logic in industrial automation.
All applications used the so-called &quot;fuzzyPLC&quot;, an
innovative hardware platform that merges fuzzy logic and
traditional automation techniques. Following a quick overview on
the fuzzyPLC, we discuss the eight (8) applications and focus on
how fuzzy logic enabled a superior solution compared to
conventional techniques. Whenever possible, we quantify the
benefit in cost saving or quality improvement. For detailed
information on the reviewed applications, the respective papers
are referenced. </em></font></p>

<h2><font size="4" face="arial">1. Fuzzy Logic in Industrial
Automation </font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In recent years, fuzzy logic has
proven well its broad potential in industrial automation
applications. In this application area, engineers primarily rely
on proven concepts. For discrete event control, they mostly use
ladder logic, a programming language resembling electrical wiring
schemes and running on so called programmable logic controllers
(PLC). For continuous control, either bang-bang type or PID type
controllers are mostly employed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">While PID type controllers do work
fine when the process under control is in a stable condition,
they do not cope well in other cases: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">The presence of strong
        disturbances (non-linearity) </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Time-varying parameters of
        the process (non-linearity) </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Presence of dead times </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The reason for this is that a PID
controller assumes the process to behave in a strictly linear
fashion. While this simplification can be made in a stable
condition, strong disturbances can push the process operation
point far away from the set operating point. Here, the linear
assumption usually does not work any more. The same happens if a
process changes its parameters over time. In these cases, the
extension or replacement of PID controllers with fuzzy
controllers has been shown to be more feasible more often than
using conventional but sophisticated state controllers or
adaptive approaches [4]. However, this is not the only area where
there is potential for fuzzy logic based solutions. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Multi-Variable Control </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The real potential of fuzzy logic
in industrial automation lies in the straightforward way fuzzy
logic renders possible the design of multi-variable controllers.
In many applications, keeping a single process variable constant
can be done well using a PID or bang-bang type controller.
However, set values for all these individual control loops are
often still set manually by operators. The operators analyze the
process condition, and tune the set values of the PID controllers
to optimize the operation. This is called &quot;supervisory
control&quot; and mostly involves multiple variables. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="mv-ctrl.gif" width="603"
height="195"> <i><br>
Figure </i></font><a name="f_1_multi_variable_control"><font
size="2" face="arial"><i>1: Using a Fuzzy Logic Controller to
Determine the Set Values for Underlying PID Control Loops </i></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">Alas, both PID and bang-bang type
controllers can only cope with one variable. This usually results
in several independently operating control loops. These loops are
not able to &quot;talk to each other&quot;. In cases where it is
desirable or necessary to exploit interdependencies of physical
variables, one is forced to set up a complete mathematical model
of the process and to derive differential equations from it that
are necessary for the implementation of a solution. In the world
of industrial automation, this is rarely feasible: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Creating a mathematical model
        for a real-word problem can involve years of work. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Most mathematical models
        involve extensive simplifications and linearizations that
        require &quot;fudge&quot; factors to optimize the
        resulting controller later on. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Tuning the fudge factors of a
        controller derived from a mathematical model is
        &quot;fishing in the dark&quot;, because optimizing the
        system at one operating point using global factors
        usually degrades the performance at other operating
        points. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">Also, many practitioners do not
have the background required for rigorous mathematical modeling.
Thus, the general observation in industry is that single process
variables are controlled by simple control models such as PID or
bang-bang, while supervisory control is done by human operators. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">This is where fuzzy logic provides
an elegant and highly efficient solution to the problem. Fuzzy
logic lets engineers design supervisory multi-variable
controllers from operator experience and experimental results
rather than from mathematical models. A possible structure of a
fuzzy logic based control system in industrial automation
applications is exemplified by Figure 1. Each single process
variable is kept constant by a PID controller, while the set
values for the PID controller stem from the fuzzy logic system.
This arrangement is typical for cases like control of several
temperature zones of an oven or control of oxygen concentrations
in different zones of a wastewater basin. In other cases, it
could be reasonable to develop the complete closed loop control
solution in a fuzzy system.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">This illustrates why it is very
desirable to integrate conventional control engineering
techniques, such as ladder logic or instruction list language for
digital logic and PID control blocks tightly together with fuzzy
logic functionality. </font></p>

<h2><a name="fuzzyplc"><font size="4" face="arial">2. Merging
Fuzzy Logic and PLCs </font></a></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In 1990, when more and more
successful applications proved the potential of fuzzy logic in
industrial automation, the German company Klockner-Moeller and
the U.S./German company Inform Software created the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC
based on the observation that fuzzy logic needs tight integration
with conventional industrial automation techniques. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">The <i>fuzzy</i>PLC Hardware and
Firmware </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_fplc.gif" width="300"
height="233"> <i><br>
Figure </i></font><a name="f_2_fuzzyplc"><font size="2"
face="arial"><i>2: The fuzzyPLC Contains Fuzzy and Conventional
Logic Processing Capabilities, Field Bus Connections, and
Interfaces </i></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">To make it available at a low
cost, the core of the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC uses a highly integrated
two-chip solution. An analog ASIC handles the analog/digital
interfaces at industry standard 12 bit resolution. Snap-On
modules can extend the periphery for large applications of up to
about 100 signals. An integrated field bus connection, based on
RS485, provides further expansion by networking. The conventional
and the fuzzy logic computation is handled by a 16/32 bit RISC
microcontroller. The operating system and communication routines,
developed by Klockner-Moeller, are based on a commercial real
time multitasking kernel. The fuzzy inference engine, developed
by Inform Software, is implemented and integrated into the
operating system in a highly efficient manner, so that scan times
of less than one millisecond are possible. The internal RAM of
256 KB can be expanded by memory cards using flash technology.
Thus, the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC is capable of solving quite complex and
fast industrial automation problems in spite of its compact and
low price design. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">The <i>fuzzy</i>PLC Engineering
Software </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The <i>fuzzy</i>PLC is programmed
by an enhanced version of the standard fuzzy logic system
development software <i>fuzzy</i>TECH from Inform Software. <i>fuzzy</i>TECH
is an all-graphical, design, simulation, and optimization
environment with implementation modules for most microcontrollers
and industrial computers. To support the complete functionality
of the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC, <i>fuzzy</i>TECH has been enhanced with
editors and functions to support the conventional programming of
the PLC. Thus, a user only needs one tool to program both
conventional and fuzzy logic parts of the solution. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="suco.gif" width="941"

size="2" face="arial"><i>3: Both the Traditional Logic and the
Fuzzy Logic System Is Programmed By fuzzyTECH 40 </i></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The <i>fuzzy</i>TECH software
combines all necessary editors for membership functions,
linguistic variables, rule tables, and system structure with
analyzer functions and optimization features. The software runs
on a PC and is linked to the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC by a standard serial
cable (RS232) or the field bus (RS485). Through this link, the
developer downloads the designed system to the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC.
Because fuzzy logic systems often require optimization
&quot;on-the-fly&quot;, <i>fuzzy</i>TECH and the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC
feature &quot;online-debugging&quot; where the system running on
the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC is completely visualized by the graphical
editors and analyzers of <i>fuzzy</i>TECH. Plus, in
online-debugging modes, any modification of the fuzzy logic
system is instantly translated to the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC without
halting operation. </font></p>

<h2><font size="4" face="arial">3. Application Case Studies </font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In this section, we review eight
(8) recent highly successful applications of fuzzy logic in
industrial automation using the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Anti-Sway Control of Cranes </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Fire Zone Control in Waste
        Incineration Plants </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Dosing Control in Waste Water
        Treatment Plants </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Control of Tunnel Inspection
        Robots </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Positioning in Presses </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Temperature Control in
        Plastic Molding Machines </font></li>

        Automation </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">Wind Energy Converter Control
        </font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Anti-Sway Control of Cranes </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In crane control, the objective is
to position a load over a target point. While the load connected
to the crane head by flexible cables may well sway within certain
limits during transportation, the sway must be reduced to almost
zero for load release when the target position is reached. Hence,
a controller must use at least two input variables, for example
position and sway angle. Thus, a simple PID controller cannot be
used as it is restricted to one input. Conventional solutions of
the problem require highly elaborate approaches, like model based
control or state variable controllers, that need intensive
engineering and hardware resources. These technologies tend to
push system costs into regions that make anti-sway systems
economically unaffordable. For these reasons, most cranes are
still operated manually. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_kran.gif" width="300"
height="184"> <i><br>
Figure 4: The 64 Ton crane of Hochtief Corp. Uses fuzzyPLC Based
Anti-Sway Positioning Control</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In spite of the difficulties
involved with automated control, human operators can control
cranes quite well in most cases. Because fuzzy logic is a
technology that facilitates control system design based directly
on such human experiences, it has been used for crane automation
for almost a decade. The types of cranes include container cranes
in harbors, steel pan cranes, and cranes in a manufacturing
environment. Recently, a 64 ton crane that transports concrete
modules for bridges and tunnels over a distance of 500 yards has
been automated with a <i>fuzzy</i>PLC in Germany [8]. The benefit
was a capacity gain of about 20% due to the faster transportation
and an increase in safety. Accidents were frequent, because the
crane operators walk parallel to the crane during operation with
a remote controller. Before, when they had to watch the load to
concentrate on the sway angle, they frequently stumbled over
parts lying on the ground. The crane was commissioned in Spring
1995 and the fuzzy logic anti-sway controller has been
continuously enabled by the crane operator, showing the high
degree of acceptance by the operators. This fact is of special
importance since not only technological feasibility but also
psychological aspects are important for the success of an
industrial automation solution. </font></p>

width="640" height="400"> <i><br>
Figure 5: A Software Simulation of the Crane Controller Is
Contained In [4]</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">A software simulation and a simple
example of an anti-sway crane controller for didactic purposes
can be found in [4]. The real solution uses about 10 inputs, 2
outputs, and 4 rule blocks with a total of 75 rules. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Fire Zone Control in Waste
Incineration Plants </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">Maintaining a stable burning
temperature in waste incineration plants is important to minimize
the generation of toxic gases, such as dioxin and furan, as well
as to avoid corrosion in the burning chambers. There are two
primary difficulties of this temperature control process: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">The caloric value of the
        waste fluctuates strongly. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="arial">The fire position and shape
        cannot be measured directly. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">Because the heat generated from
the burning process is used to produce electrical energy, a
stable incineration process is also of high commercial interest. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_waste.gif"
width="300" height="341"> <i><br>
Figure 6: In a Waste Incineration Plan, a Crane Continuously
Delivers Waste from the Bunker to the Belt Running through the
Burning Zone. The Exhaust Gases Are Cooled And Cleaned</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In recent applications at waste
incineration plants in the cities of Hamburg and Mannheim in
Germany, fuzzy logic has been successfully applied. In Mannheim,
where two <i>fuzzy</i>PLCs were used to control the burning
process, the steam generation capacity of one furnace is 28 Mg/h.
Using the industry standard conventional controller, steam
generation fluctuated by as much as 10 Mg/h in just one hour. The
fuzzy logic controller was capable of reducing this fluctuation
to less than ±1 Mg/h. This dramatically improved robustness and
also caused the NOx and SO2 emission to drop slightly, and the CO
emission to drop to half [11, 12]. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Dosing Control in Waste Water
Treatment Plants </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">Waste water treatment processes
are a combination of biological, chemical, and mechanical
processes. This makes the creation of a complete mathematical
model for their control intractable. However, there is a large
amount of human experience that can be exploited for automated
controller design. As such operator experience can be efficiently
put to work by fuzzy logic, many plants already use this
technique [4]. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In a recent application in Bonn,
dosing of liquid FeCl3 for phosphate precipitation has been
successfully automated using the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC. Recently
changes in legislation require water treatment plants in Germany
to limit the total amount of phosphate in the released water to 1
milligram per liter. To extract the phosphate from the water,
FeCl3 is added, which converts the phosphate into FePO4 that is
sedimented with the sludge. Because a violation of the legal
phosphate limit results in severe penalties, the operators tend
to overdose the FeCl3. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_klaer.gif"
width="300" height="236"> <i><br>
Figure 7: By Injecting FeCl3 Into the Sludge, Dissolved Phosphate
Precipitates from the Waste Water</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">To optimize the FeCl3 dosing, a
fuzzy logic controller that uses the input variables phosphate
concentration, its derivative, water flow, its derivative, and
dry substance contents was designed. The output of the fuzzy
logic controller is the change of the set variable for the
injected FeCl3. An underlying conventional PI type controller
stabilizes the FeCl3 flow to this set point. The PI type
controller is implemented as a function block in the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC
as well. This is an example of the combination of fuzzy logic and
conventional control engineering techniques.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_water.gif"
width="640" height="430"> <i><br>
Figure 8: A Software Simulation of a Simplified Precipitation
Controller Is Contained in [4]</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The total fuzzy logic controller
uses 207 rules to express the control strategy based on the five
(5) input variables of the fuzzy logic control block. The total
implementation time was three (3) staff months and resulted in
savings of about 50% of the FeCl3 compared to the manual control
before. Taking implementation time and hardware/software costs
into consideration with the savings on FeCl3 results a return in
investment time of half a year. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Control of Tunnel Inspection
Robots </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The German Aerospace corporation
DASA has developed a sewage pipe inspection system using two
robot units and a support truck [7]. The objective of the robots
is to detect leakage in segments of the pipe by applying air
pressure to the sealed space between the two robots. Because the
vertical access shafts can be quite far away from each other, the
robots have to operate up to 400 yards away from the truck. The
robots are connected to each other and the truck by cables that
provide air pressure, electrical energy, and control signals to
the robots. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_polis.gif"
width="300" height="163"> <i><br>
Figure 9: The Two Robot Units in the Sewage Pipe (right) Are
Supplied From a Specialized Truck By Cables</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">When DASA developed the system, a
severe control problem came up. To avoid entanglement of the
cables that can result in the robots getting stuck in the pipe,
cable tension must be controlled very carefully. A conventional
approach using complex state variable controllers turned out to
be too costly in terms of both money and design time. A control
system implemented on two <i>fuzzy</i>PLCs using about 200 rules
each showed very good results in a very short engineering time at
less than 10% of the costs of a conventional solution. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Positioning of Presses </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">One area with big potential for
fuzzy solutions is the control of drives. In this example, we
discuss hydraulic axis control. One of the most complex fuzzy
projects was done for a hydraulic press used to press laminates,
printed circuit boards, and floor coverings. The task was the
synchronized control of a 14-axis system. The position control of
the axis, a superimposed pressure controller, the parallel
running of the steel belt and the synchronization of all axes had
to be solved. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="bison011.gif"
width="300" height="299"> <i><br>
Figure 10: Control of Hydraulic Systems Is Difficult As Many
Non-Linearities, Such As the &quot;stick-slip&quot; Effect, Are
Involved</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The automation system employed has
a highly decentralized structure and consists of two large master
PLCs, a number of smaller compact PLCs, a PC based supervisory
system, and seven <i>fuzzy</i>PLCs. All units are networked using
the integrated field bus interfaces. Very important for the
synchronization of the entire machine is the ability of the field
bus network to satisfy the real time requirements. One typical
problem involved in the control of hydraulic systems is the
so-called &quot;stick slip effect&quot;. The transition of an
axis from standstill to motion is highly non-linear because of
the transition from stick friction to slip friction. This makes
designing a good controller for hydraulic systems difficult. In
the cited application, fuzzy logic rendered a good solution
technique, freeing system design from the burden of the theory of
non linear systems synthesis. The overall design time using fuzzy
logic was only a third of what a conventional approach had
required in past applications of conventional control for similar
presses [9].</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Temperature Control in Plastic
Molding Machines </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In plastic molding machines,
temperature control is crucial to achieve high and consistent
product quality. This requires laborious tuning of the involved
control algorithms, because the dead times involved in an
extrusion machine are significant and there is significant
coupling between the different temperature zones [9].</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_extru.gif"
width="300" height="314"> <i><br>
Figure 11: To Achieve High Product Quality, Keeping the
Temperature Constant Is Critical in Molding Plastic</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">To cut down the commission time
for these machines, KM corporation has developed a self-tuning
controller using the <i>fuzzy</i>PLC. At start up time, some
parameters are estimated that are used to scale the non linear
fuzzy controller. In contrast to conventional tuning algorithms,
this controller does not require a cooling down of the machine to
room temperature before self tuning can work. Even very difficult
temperature zones with big dead times can be handled by this
algorithm and the result is a very robust controller. This is
important because the temperature properties of an empty machine
and one filled with plastic material are extremely different.
Compared to conventional systems, the fuzzy logic enhanced
temperature controller performs with a faster response time and a
significantly smaller overshoot combined with extreme robustness.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Climate Control Using Fuzzy Logic
</font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">Climate control systems reveal a
high potential for energy savings. In a recent application at a
major hospital in Europe, the integration of fuzzy logic saves
about 25% on electrical energy, equivalent to the amount of
$50,000 per year. </font></p>

face="arial"><i>13: An Application of Fuzzy Logic in the A/C
System of a Large Hospital in Germany Saved More than 25% on
Energy Costs</i></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">The fuzzy logic controller outputs
the set values for the coolant valve, the water heater valve, and
the humidifier water valve. The fuzzy logic control strategy uses
different temperature and humidity sensors to determine how to
operate the air conditioning process in a way that conserves
energy. Again, the capability of processing interdependent
variables results in significant advantages over conventional
solutions. For example, one knows that when temperature rises,
relative humidity of the air decreases.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">This knowledge can be exploited by
implementing a fuzzy logic control strategy that allows the
temperature controller &quot;to tell&quot; the humidity
controller that it is going to activate the heater valve. The
humidity controller now can respond to this before it can detect
it by its sensor. The result is an increase in control quality
[4, 8]. </font></p>

</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="arial">Wind Energy Converter Control </font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">In recent years, technological
advancements made the commercial use of wind energy feasible. A
trend to larger plants further improved the cost/performance
ratio. However, such large wind energy converters require
advanced control systems both to ensure high efficiency and long
life. The controller sets the angle of the rotor blades based on
the wind situation (pitch control). However, wind is not a
one-dimensional figure. Strength, gustiness, and fluctuation of
the wind angle must be evaluated to determine the optimal rotor
blade angle. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><img src="km_wind.gif" width="200"
height="264"> <i><br>
Figure </i></font><a name="bild_viess_haus"><font size="2"
face="arial"><i>15: To Maximize the Efficiency of a Wind Energy
Converter, the Pitch Controller Must Consider Many Inputs </i></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">There is a trade-off between
efficiency, safety and wear of the wind energy converter. If the
blade angle is set to draw the maximum amount of energy from the
wind, the risk of sudden wind gusts causing excessive mechanical
stress on the converter increases. For these reasons, an Aerodyn
wind energy converter was enhanced with a fuzzy system based on
human experience to find the best compromise to this trade-off
[6]. The first implemented system is running in a field test and
shows quite promising results. The quality of the controller is
not only measured in constancy of the delivered power, but also
in measures of mechanical stress on the tower, the nacelle and
the rotor blades. The next step will be the application of the
achieved results to the first 1.2 MW systems that are to be
launched in the marketplace in 1996.</font></p>

<h1><a name="_toc295025279"><font size="5" face="arial">4.
Conclusions</font></a><font size="5" face="arial"> </font></h1>

<p><font size="2" face="arial">As a consequence of the high
degree of awareness raised by a large number of publications over
the past five years in Europe, a substantial number of successful
applications have been generated. Of these, we have presented a
selection of eight (8) recent applications in this paper. In all
applications, the key to success lies in the clever combination
of both conventional automation techniques and fuzzy logic. Fuzzy
logic by no means replaces conventional control engineering.
Rather, it compliments conventional techniques with a highly
efficient methodology to implement multi-variable control
strategies. Thus, the major potential for fuzzy logic lies in the
implementation of supervisory control loops. </font></p>
