<BR>In this paper a new original approach to the analysis of fuzzy multi-dimensional
distributions is described. A uniform method for representing the fuzzy
multi-dimensional distributions by means of sectioned vectors and matrices
is proposed. The sectioned matrix is interpreted as fuzzy conjunctive normal
form, while its line vectors are interpreted as fuzzy disjuncts. Several
useful characteristics of fuzzy distributions and disjuncts are defined
and studied. The main operation for manipulating by fuzzy multi-dimensional
distributions is a new original fuzzy resolution which is applied to any
two disjuncts on some variable and results in a third disjunct called resolvent.
The property of adjacency of two disjuncts is defined and the criterion
of adjacency is formulated. It is shown that the resolution operation proposed
is a generalization of the conventional resolution and the whole approach
can be viewed as a generalization of propositional logic. Methods for finding
prime disjuncts, projection on a variable (and thus solving the satisfiability
problem) and transforming into the dual form are proposed.

<A NAME="1"></A>1. Introduction</H2>
Let us consider the following problem. Given a n-dimensional space called
the universe of discourse equal to the Cartesian product of n variables.
There is some (global) distribution over this space which is supposed to
be represented by means of a combination of elementary (local) distributions
over individual variables. A global characteristic of the distribution
is said to be some quantity which depends on the values in all (or almost
all) points of the universe of discourse. The problem is how to calculate
a global characteristic of the distribution without the necessity to access
values in all points of the universe of discourse, i.e., taking into account
only local distributions over individual variables by means of which the
multi-dimensional distribution is represented..

<P>Such a formulation is obviously too general therefore to obtain concrete
results we have to reduce it to some more concrete case by specifying more
exactly types of variables, their sets of values, operations used for combining
distributions, global characteristics to find.

<P>One such particular but probably the most important case has been paid
a lot of attention in Logic, Algebra, Switching Theory, Cybernetics, Artificial
Intelligence, and other fields where it usually has its own name and is
described in special terms depending on the problem being solved. The main
assumptions for this case are that
<OL>
<LI>
all variables have only two values 0 and 1,</LI>

<LI>
distributions take values from the set {0,1},</LI>

<LI>
logical connectives AND and OR are used for combining elementary distributions,
and</LI>

<LI>
the maximal or minimal value is usually searched as a global characteristic.</LI>
</OL>
There are only 4 different two-valued distributions over two-valued variables
which in propositional logic are called elementary propositions (Fig. 1):
<OL>
<LI>
truth constant 0,</LI>

<LI>
truth constant 1,</LI>

<LI>
proposition P, and</LI>

<LI>
proposition ~ P.</LI>
</OL>

<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>Fig. 1. Four Boolean propositions. Both the variable
and the distribution are two-valued.&nbsp;</CAPTION>
</TABLE></CENTER>
Combining different local distributions with logical connectives AND and
OR which are interpreted with the help of conventional truth tables we
can represent different global distributions over n-dimensional hyper-cube.
One traditional problem that many other theoretical and applied problems
are reduced to, is the problem of satisfiability which is obviously equivalent
to finding the maximal value of the global distribution over the n-dimensional
universe of discourse. There is a lot of different methods and their modifications
for solving this problem, e.g., based on the operation of consensus (resolution
in the Artificial Intelligence), transformation into the dual form, covering
techniques etc.

<P>In this paper it is supposed that
<OL>
<LI>
all variables take their values from finite sets,</LI>

<LI>
all distributions are fuzzy membership functions from the domain of definition
(values of individual variables or their Cartesian product) to the unit
interval [0,1], and</LI>

<LI>
logical connectives AND and OR interpreted with the help of the minimum
and maximum operations are used for combining distributions.</LI>
</OL>
In fact, only the supposition 3 is principal. Instead of the finite sets
of values of variables we can consider the unit interval [0,1] (assumption
1) or any other continuos interval. Maximal value of the global distribution
over the universe of discourse is considered as a global characteristic
to find. We also consider a more general problem of finding a projection
of the global distribution on some variable which allows us to solve more
efficiently the problem of logical inference. There can be formulated also
other useful problems, e.g., finding a global entropy of a multi-dimensional
fuzzy distribution.

<P>Currently there are not exact methods for solving this problem. However,
there have been proposed a lot of inexact methods in the field of approximate
reasoning (mainly for application to knowledge based systems). Probably
the most well-known of them is the Zadeh's combination and projection principle
[<A HREF="#Zd75">Zd75</A>, <A HREF="#Zd79">Zd79</A>]. This method consists
in that
<OL>
<LI>
each statement is translated into a possibility distribution,</LI>

<LI>
all possibility distributions are conjunctively (with the help of minimum
operation) <I>combined</I> into an overall possibility distribution PI,</LI>

<LI>
the distribution PI is <I>projected</I> on various variables of interest
(for instance, using the generalized modus ponens).</LI>
</OL>
Unfortunately, it is only a principle and does not provide us a concrete
procedure for finding projections. The main disadvantage of other approaches
see, e.g., [<A HREF="#KS90">KS90</A>]) is that they do not guarantee that
the conclusion (projection) obtained is correct like similar methods in
the Boolean fields (Switching Theory, Boolean functions, Propositional
Logic etc.). In other words, we do not know whether the projection resulted
from the procedure is equal to the real projection of our distribution.

<P>In this paper we propose a new original operation of fuzzy resolution
which can used to solve this problem. We will suppose that the global distribution
is represented by means of a number of fuzzy disjuncts combined with the
connective AND (minimum). Each fuzzy disjunct consist of n local distributions
(possibly trivial) combined with the connective OR. The operation of fuzzy
resolution is applied to any two disjuncts on some variable and results
in a third disjunct called resolvent (consensus). The resolvent possesses
several useful properties (described in below in the paper) which allows
us to say that this operation is a generalization of the conventional resolution.
Thus having this fuzzy resolution we can more or less easily transfer onto
fuzzy case almost all resolution (consensus) based methods developed for
the boolean case.

<P>This paper originates from an original approach of Zakrevsky [<A HREF="#Zk89">Zk89</A>,
<A HREF="#Zk94">Zk94</A>] called the logic of finite predicates where a
new technique of sectioned boolean vectors for representing disjuncts and
the corresponding consensus operation was proposed. On the basis of the
technique of Boolean sectioned vectors and matrices a diagnostic expert
system shell EDIP was implemented [<A HREF="#L90">L90</A>, <A HREF="#LS91">LS91</A>,
<A HREF="#LS92">LS92</A>]. An inference process in the system EDIP is based
on the procedure of finding all prime vector disjuncts by means of the
operation of generalized consensus.

<P>Later [<A HREF="#S91">S91</A>, <A HREF="#S93a">S93a</A>, <A HREF="#LS93a">LS93a</A>,
<A HREF="#S93b">S93b</A>] the formalism of Zakrevsky including the technique
of sectioned vectors and the operation of consensus was generalized on
fuzzy case where the components take their values from the unit interval
[0,1]. In addition some new properties degenerated in the crisp case were
studied, as well as new procedures of logical inference were developed
which underlie an expert system shell EDIP for Windows 3.x [<A HREF="#S96b">S96b</A>].
In this generalization of the formalism of Zakrevsky instead of the term
'consensus' the term 'resolution' was used, which is conventional in the
Artificial Intelligence.

<P>This approach to fuzzy multi-dimensional analysis was reformulated in
logical terms as a generalized fuzzy propositional logic [<A HREF="#S93b">S93b</A>,
<A HREF="#S93c">S93c</A>] and a logic of possibility distributions [<A HREF="#S96a">S96a</A>].
It was also applied to such fields as diagnosis [<A HREF="#LS94a">LS94a</A>],
fuzzy control [<A HREF="#LS94b">LS94b</A>], aggregation of information
[<A HREF="#LS94c">LS94c</A>, <A HREF="#LS96">LS96</A>].

<A NAME="2"></A>2. Method of Sectioned Vectors and Matrices</H2>
Let x<SUB>1</SUB>,x<SUB>2</SUB>,...,x<SUB>n</SUB> be elementary logical
variables, each of them taking its values from the sets X<SUB>1</SUB>,X<SUB>2</SUB>,...,X<SUB>n</SUB>
called (elementary) domains respectively. In general, domains are supposed
to be any continuos interval but in examples for the sake of simplicity
we will consider only the case of domains consisting of a finite number
of values a<SUB>ij</SUB>, where i=1,2,...,n, and j=1,2,...,n<SUB>i</SUB>.
The Cartesian product of all domains X<SUB>1</SUB>&times;X<SUB>2</SUB>&times;...&times;X<SUB>n</SUB>
forms the universe of discourse O with the power in the finite case n<SUB>1</SUB>&times;n<SUB>2</SUB>&times;...&times;n<SUB>n</SUB>.
Each element o=&lt;x<SUB>1</SUB>,x<SUB>2</SUB>,...,x<SUB>n</SUB>> in O
is an ordered n-tuple of the values of all variables.

<P>Below in this section we describe a technique which we use to write
fuzzy disjuncts. This technique was originally proposed by Zakrevsky for
the case of multi-valued variables and two-valued distributions. Later
it was generalized by Savinov onto the case of fuzzy distributions. In
the method of sectioned vectors we use the following terminology:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>component</I> <B>v</B><SUB>ij</SUB> of the vector <B>v</B> is one number
which is equal to the local distribution value in one point of the domain;
in the case of crisp distributions it is equal either 0 or 1; in the fuzzy
case it takes values from the interval [0,1]; in other words, the component
<B>v</B><SUB>ij</SUB> is equal to the local distribution value in the point
x<SUB>i</SUB>=a<SUB>ij</SUB>, where a<SUB>ij</SUB> is j-th value of i-th
variable;</LI>

<LI>
<I>section</I> <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB> is a sequence of n<SUB>i</SUB> components
for all values of one local distribution, e.g., if <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>={0.7,
1, 0.2, 0} then <B>v</B><SUB>i1</SUB>=0.7, <B>v</B><SUB>i2</SUB>=1, <B>v</B><SUB>i3</SUB>=0.2,
<B>v</B><SUB>i4</SUB>=0;</LI>

<LI>
<I>vector</I> <B>v</B> consists of n sections <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB> separated
by points (when the operation is implicitely implied) or explicitely by
the name of operation, e.g., {0.7, 1, 0.2, 0}.{1, 0.4, 0}.{1, 0}, where
n<SUB>1</SUB>=4, n<SUB>2</SUB>=3, n<SUB>3</SUB>=2.</LI>

<LI>
<I>matrix</I> is made up of a number of vectors each of them representing
one line.</LI>
</UL>
An interpretation of fuzzy vector is a rule by means of which we can compute
the global distribution this vector defines over the universe of discourse
proceeding from the local distributions the vector is made up. There are
two interpretations of fuzzy vectors: as disjuncts and as conjuncts. If
the vector <B>d</B> is interpreted as disjunct then the value of its global
distribution in some point is equal to the maximum of n corresponding components
(Fig. 2).

<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>Fig. 2. Interpretation of the vector as disjunct

</TABLE></CENTER>
For example, the disjunct

<TD>{0.7, 1, 0.2, 0}</TD>

<TD>{1, 0.4, 0}</TD>

</TABLE></CENTER>
defines the distribution which in the point &lt;a<SUB>13</SUB>,a<SUB>22</SUB>,a<SUB>32</SUB>>
is equal to max(0.2, 0.4, 0)=0.4.

<P>The interpretation of sectioned vectors as conjuncts is dual, i.e.,
it uses the operation of minimum.

<P>Sectioned matrices have two interpretations: as conjunctive normal form
(CNF) and as disjunctive normal form (DNF). The interpretation as CNF means
that the value in some point of the universe of discourse is equal to the
minimum of the values which are assigned to this point by its lines. The
lines of the CNF are interpreted as disjuncts.

<P>It can be easily proved that any fuzzy distribution over the universe
of discourse can be represented in the form of fuzzy CNF. Such a CNF is
made up of |O|=n<SUB>1</SUB>&times;n<SUB>2</SUB>&times;...&times;n<SUB>n</SUB>
line disjuncts each of them representing a value of the fuzzy distribution
in the corresponding point of the universe of discourse. In other words
one line of this matrix is responsible for representing the distribution
value in some point and it does not influences all other points. Each section
of the disjunct satisfying this condition has to consist of all 1 except
for one component which is equal to the corresponding distribution value.
We say that it pricks a hole down to the necessary level in the distribution
surface. Of course, it is not a procedure for building and representing
fuzzy multi-dimensional distributions -- it only demonstrates that for
any arbitrary fuzzy distribution there exists a sectioned matrix interpreted
as CNF which represents it (i.e., with the same semantics).
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="3"></A>3. Characteristics of Disjuncts</H2>
In this section we define three global characteristics of fuzzy distributions.
Here 'global' characteristic means that to calculate it one needs to access
all elements of the domain of definition and corresponding fuzzy distribution
values. All these properties are formulated for fuzzy distributions but
can be also used for describing their forms of representation, e.g., for
characterizing fuzzy disjuncts.

<P>The maximal value that the fuzzy distribution takes over the domain
of definition is said to be the <I>consistency</I> (Fig. 3).

<P>For example, the local distribution {0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7} has the consistency
0.7, and the consistency of the disjunct {0, 0.5}.{1, 0, 0} is equal to
1.

<P>The minimal value that fuzzy distribution takes over the domain of definition
is said to be the <I>constant</I> (Fig. 3).
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=5 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="fmda_3.gif" ALT="Fig. 3. Consistency and constant of the distribution." HEIGHT=113 WIDTH=347>&nbsp;</CENTER>
</TD>
</TR>

<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>Fig. 3. Consistency and constant of the distribution.&nbsp;</CAPTION>
</TABLE></CENTER>
For example, the local distribution {0.1, 0.5, 1} and the disjunct {0,
0.5}.{1, 0, 0} have the constants 0.1 and 0 respectively.

<P>We will need a quantity called a degree of <I>incomparability</I> of
two distributions. Let us define at first a relative degree of incomparability.
The degree of incomparability of the distribution P in relation to Q is
equal to the maximal value of the distribution P which is exactly greater
than the corresponding (i.e., in the same point of the universe) value
of the proposition Q:
<CENTER>incomp<SUB>Q</SUB>(P) = max(P(x)), where P(x) > Q(x)</CENTER>


<P>Thus in order to compute this quantity one at first needs to select
in P all the values which are exactly greater than the corresponding values
in Q, and then to choose among them the maximal value (Fig. 4).
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=5 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="fmda_4.gif" ALT="Fig. 4. Relative degree of incomparability." HEIGHT=132 WIDTH=340>&nbsp;</CENTER>
</TD>
</TR>

<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>Fig. 4. Relative degree of incomparability.&nbsp;</CAPTION>
</TABLE></CENTER>
In the case where the condition
<CENTER>forall x P(x) &lt;= Q(x)</CENTER>


<P>holds, i.e., there is nothing to choose the maximal value from (the
distribution P is included into Q), it is supposed by definition that incomp<SUB>Q</SUB>(P)=0.

<P>For example, degree of incomparability of the proposition P={0, 0.5,
0.7, 1} in relation to the proposition Q={0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1} is equal to
incomp<SUB>Q</SUB>(P)=max(0.5,0.7)=0.7, whereas incomp<SUB>P</SUB>(Q)=max(0.2)
= 0.2.

<P>The (mutual) degree of incomparability is equal to the minimal of two
relative degrees of incomparability:
<CENTER>incomp(P,Q) = min( incompQ(P),incompP(Q))</CENTER>


<P>Note that it is important that the degree of incomparability is defined
not from informal interpretation of the word "incomparable" but from the
formal requirements of the fuzzy resolution what will be shown below.

<P>Consequence relation on fuzzy distributions is defined in a traditional
way. Namely, the distribution Q is said to be a logical consequence of
the distribution P iff the condition
<CENTER>forall x P(x) &lt;= Q(x)</CENTER>


<P>holds, i.e., P is included into Q.

<P>Obviously, if Q is a logical consequence of P then Q can be removed
from a set axioms or theorems. In particular, disjunct which is a consequence
of another disjunct can be removed from the matrix. The process of removing
such disjuncts is called absorption.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="4"></A>4. Reduced Forms of Disjuncts</H2>
Let us consider the following example. Three disjuncts
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD>{1, 0, 1, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0.5, 1}</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>{1, 0.5, 1, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0, 1}</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>{1, 0.5, 1, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0.2, 1}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
are semantically equivalent, i.e., they represent the same distribution
over the universe of discourse. Thus in general case disjuncts represent
semantics not uniquely, i.e., several different on the form disjuncts can
represent the same on the meaning proposition about the universe. The uniqueness
of representation takes place only for disjuncts with the constant equal
to 0, when there is at least one element from the universe with the distribution
value 0. If the disjunct constant (the minimal value of the corresponding
distribution) is not equal to 0, then its representation is not unique
because the components which are between 0 and the disjunct constant may
be changed in this interval (provided that this does not change the constant
itself). So it is clear that in the disjunct
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD>{1, 0, 1, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0.5, 1}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
with the constant 0.5 the second component of the first section may be
changed between 0 and 0.5, e.g.,
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD>{1, 0.27, 1, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0.5, 1}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
To overcome this non-uniqueness of representation let us introduce a so
called <I>reduced forms</I> of disjunct. The disjunct <B>d</B> is said
to be in k-th reduced form iff the constants of all its sections <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>
except for the k-th section <B>d</B><SUB>k</SUB> are equal to 0
<CENTER>constant(<B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>) = min(<B>d</B><SUB>ij</SUB>) = 0</CENTER>


<P>and all the rest of components are exactly greater than constant(<B>d</B><SUB>k</SUB>):

<P>In other words, disjunct in k-th reduced form may not contain components
in the interval (0,constant(<B>d</B><SUB>k</SUB>)] (i.e., any component
is either equal to 0 or is greater than constant(<B>d</B><SUB>k</SUB>),
and in addition, each proposition must include at least one component equal
to 0 except for the k-th section. For example, the disjunct
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</TABLE></CENTER>
&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;is in 1st reduced form, whereas the disjuncts

are not reduced.

<P>This definition does not say how to reduce disjuncts. Now we will propose
a procedure for reducing disjuncts which is based on operations of subtraction/addition
of the value p from/to the section <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>. This operations
result in a new local distribution <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>-p/<B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>+p
such that
<CENTER><B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>-p = <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>, if <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>
> p</CENTER>

<CENTER><B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>-p = 0, otherwise</CENTER>


<P>and
<CENTER><B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>+p = <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>, if <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>
> p</CENTER>

<CENTER><B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>+p = p, otherwise</CENTER>


<P>Thus to compute <B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>-p (<B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB>+p) we have
to change onto 0 (p) all the components which are less than or equal to
p (Fig. 5).

<LI>
find the disjunct constant:</LI>

<BR>constant(<B>d</B>) = max( min(<B>d</B><SUB>1j</SUB>),...,min(<B>d</B><SUB>nj</SUB>)
)
<BR>(The disjunct constant is equal to the maximum of all local constants.)
<LI>
subtract the disjunct constant from all non-k-th propositions</LI>

<LI>
add the disjunct constant to the k-th proposition</LI>
</OL>
For example, the constant of the disjunct
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD>{0, 0.2, 0.3, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0.3, 1}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
is equal to 0.3, therefore its 1st reduced form is the following:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD>{0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0, 1}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
According to this approach if a disjunct is in a reduced form then it involves
a section which is responsible for storing the disjunct constant value.
We can transfer the constant from one section to another but such a section
will always exist and thus we have n different reduced forms.

<P>Another approach [<A HREF="#S93b">S93b</A>, <A HREF="#S93c">S93c</A>,
<A HREF="#S96a">S96a</A>] consists in that we introduce one special component
which is responsible for storing the disjunct constant value and is said
to be also the disjunct constant (or constant proposition in logical terms).
For the sake of simplicity such a representation is not used in this paper
but it is really useful in many situations (e.g., when representing disjuncts
in knowledge base) since the reduced form is defined uniquely and the disjunct
constant is represented explicitly.

<A NAME="5"></A>5. Resolution Principle</H2>

<H3>
5.1. General Definition</H3>
Logical inference usually consists in that new disjuncts are built from
the source disjuncts. Then they are added to the CNF and can serve as premises
for continuing the inference process. Here we will not touch the question
what logical inference is needed for and which requirements it have to
meet. We will only consider how disjuncts can be generated.

<P>The main operation for generating disjuncts can serve a fuzzy resolution.
It is applied to two disjuncts on some section (variable) and results in
a third disjunct called a resolvent. If <B>u</B> and <B>v</B> are two disjuncts
and <B>w</B> is their resolvent on k-th variable, then we write:
<CENTER><B>u</B>&lt;x<SUB>k</SUB>><B>v</B> = <B>w</B></CENTER>


<P>where &lt;x<SUB>k</SUB>> denotes the resolution on k-th variable.

<P>Now let us consider how given two premises the resolvent is built. Each
section of the resolvent depends on (is constructed from) only two corresponding
sections of the premises. k-th proposition of the resolvent (which the
resolution is applied to) is equal to the conjunction of the two corresponding
propositions from the source disjuncts; every non-k-th proposition of the
resolvent is equal to the disjunction of the two corresponding propositions:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>w</B><SUB>i</SUB> = <B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB> AND <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>,
<B>w</B><SUB>ij</SUB> = min(<B>u</B><SUB>ij</SUB>, <B>v</B><SUB>ij</SUB>),
if i = k, j = 1,2,...,n <SUB>i</SUB>
<BR><B>w</B><SUB>i</SUB> = <B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB> OR <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>,
<B>w</B><SUB>ij</SUB> = max(<B>u</B><SUB>ij</SUB>, <B>v</B><SUB>ij</SUB>),
otherwise</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Conjunction and disjunction of elementary propositions about the same variable
are equal to the componentwise minimum and maximum, respectively.

<P>The resolution operation can be represented in the form of the following
pattern (Fig. 6):

The main property of the resolvent is that it is a consequence of two its
premises:
<CENTER>If <B>w</B> = <B>u</B> &lt;x<SUB>k</SUB>> <B>v</B>, then <B>u</B>
AND <B>v</B> |= <B>w</B>.</CENTER>


<P>It means that we can add any resolvent to the CNF containing its two
premises and the the whole semantics will not change.

<P>If there is only one variable, then we obtain extensional case and the
resolution is reduced to ordinary conjunction. Thus the resolution operation
in some sense can be viewed as a generalization of conjunction onto multidimensional
case.

<P>In the case of two-valued variables and two-valued distributions the
behavior of this resolution coincides with that for the classical case
of boolean propositions except for the fact that our resolution can be
applied to any two disjuncts even if their k-th propositions are not contrary
and/or there exist non-k-th contrary propositions. It is obvious that in
the first case the resolvent will be a consequence of one of its premises,
while in the second case it will be valid, i.e., involve the constant proposition
1.

<P>Let us consider the following example.
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">
<CENTER><B>u</B>&nbsp;</CENTER>
</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}=0</TD>

<TD>{0, 1}=x<SUB>3</SUB></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
In this classical example of the boolean resolution we obtain "good" resolvent
since sections <B>u</B><SUB>2</SUB> and <B>v</B><SUB>2</SUB> are contrary,
while other sections are not. Each section is written in sectioned form
and conventional form with the help of boolean propositions.

<P>In the following example we obtain the resolvent which is a consequence
of (weaker than) both premises since the sections <B>u</B><SUB>2</SUB>
and <B>v</B><SUB>2</SUB> are not contrary. Note that classical resolution
is not applied to such disjuncts.

contrary non-k-th propositions which result in the constant proposition
1 in the resolvent.

5.2. Resolution on Reduced Disjuncts</H3>
If to consider the resolution as being a generalization of conjunction
(multidimensional conjunction), then it is natural to suppose that its
goal is to infer the disjunct which is equivalent to the conjunction of
two source disjuncts. In that case the resolvent would represent just both
source premises in one clause, and consequently the source disjuncts could
be removed as superfluous. However, such ideal variant is unrealizable
because the conjunction of two disjuncts in general case cannot be represented
in the form of only one disjunct. Nevertheless, it is possible to formulate
the criterion of "quality" of one resolution operation or another: the
closer the semantics of two disjuncts is approximated by their resolvent,
the better the resolution rule.

<P>It is a characteristic property of the general definition of the resolution
formulated in the previous section that the resolvent content (semantics,
i.e., the corresponding fuzzy distribution) depends on the premises form.
In the following two examples the premises have different forms but the
semantics is the same, while the resolvents have different semantics:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >

&nbsp;

</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{1, 0.3}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
Thus the question arises: which form of premises is the best from the point
of view of the above formulated criterion, or which form of premises generates
the strongest resolvent.

<P>The resolvent components are decreased only in k-th section when conjuncting
two source sections (in the rest of sections the components can be only
increased), i.e., it is exactly k-th section that is responsible for non-trivial
semantical properties of the resolvent. The higher component values in
disjunctive (non-k-th) sections, the weaker the resolvent. In ideal case
when all non-k-th sections consist of only zero components the resolvent
is exactly equal to the conjunction of two premises, for example:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">
<CENTER><B>u</B>&nbsp;</CENTER>
</TD>

<TD>{0, 0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{1, 0.5, 0.3}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">
<CENTER><B>v</B>&nbsp;</CENTER>
</TD>

<TD>{0, 0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0.5, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">
<CENTER><B>w</B> = <B>u</B>&lt;x<SUB>2</SUB>><B>v</B>&nbsp;</CENTER>
</TD>

<TD>{0, 0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0.5, 0.3}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
Here the constant of the first disjunct is equal to 0.3, and the constant
of the second disjunct is equal to 0. If in this example the constant of
the first disjunct is transferred from the second sections (<B>u</B><SUB>2</SUB>=<B>u</B><SUB>2</SUB>-0.3)
into any other disjunctive section (e.g., the third one, i.e., <B>u</B><SUB>3</SUB>=<B>u</B><SUB>3</SUB>+0.3),
then the resolvent becomes worse, i.e., weaker than that in the ideal case:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">
<CENTER><B>u</B>&nbsp;</CENTER>
</TD>

<TD>{0, 0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{1, 0.5, 0}</TD>

<TD>{0.3, 0.3}</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">

</TD>

<TD>{0, 0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0.5, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">
<CENTER><B>w</B> = <B>u</B>&lt;x<SUB>2</SUB>><B>v</B></CENTER>
</TD>

<TD>{0, 0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0.5, 0}</TD>

<TD>{0.3, 0.3}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
It becomes more clear if the resolvent obtained is transformed into the
following equivalent form (2nd reduced form):
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0"><B>w</B> = <B>u</B>&lt;x<SUB>2</SUB>><B>v</B></TD>

<TD>{0, 0, 0}</TD>

<TD>{0.3, 0.5, 0.3}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
Thus our conclusion is that in order to infer the strongest resolvent on
k-th section, the premises have to be transformed into the k-th reduced
form. However all below described properties of the resolution will be
formulated for the general definition independent of the premises form.
<H3>
5.3. Adjacency of Disjuncts</H3>
Although the goal of the application of resolution is to obtain a new non-trivial
disjunct differing from both the first premise and the second premise,
this requirement can be satisfied not always (it is not satisfied for the
majority of disjunct pairs and variables). More exactly two disjuncts <B>u</B>
and <B>v</B> are said to be <I>adjacent</I> on the variable x<SUB>k</SUB>
if their resolvent on k-th variable is not a logical consequence of the
disjunct <B>u</B> and disjunct <B>v</B>, i.e., it cannot be absorbed by
its premises.

<P>Now it is clear that it makes sense to apply the resolution to only
adjacent disjuncts, otherwise the resolvent is a consequence of one of
two premises and it does not contain new information. For example, the
following two disjuncts are adjacent on the first variable and they are
not adjacent on the second variable:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >

<TD>{1, 0.5, 1}</TD>

<TD>{0, 0}</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
In this context the problem can be formulated as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>how to find out whether two disjuncts are adjacent or they
are not, making use only their form, without constructing the resolvent</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
This problem can be solved with the help of the following criterion.

<P>Disjuncts <B>u</B> and <B>v</B> are adjacent on the variable x<SUB>k</SUB>
iff forall i=1,...,n except for i=k
<CENTER>constant(<B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB> OR <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>) &lt; incomp(<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>,<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>)</CENTER>


<P>In other words the minimal value of the disjunction of two sections
<B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB> and <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB> has to be strictly less than
the degree of incomparability of the sections <B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB> and
<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>. Informally two disjuncts are adjacent if and only
if the mutual degree of incomparability of two sections <B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>
and <B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB> (which the resolution is applied to) is high enough
to compensate the validity resulted from the disjunction of non-k-th sections.

<P>Thus the adjacency of two disjuncts is influenced by the following two
factors:
<OL>
<LI>
too low degree of incomparability of the propositions about k-th variable;</LI>

<LI>
too high constant (degree of validity) in non-k-th sections.</LI>
</OL>
The first factor is a generalization of the conventional condition (see,
e.g., [<A HREF="#CL73">CL73</A>]) that the resolution is applied only to
disjuncts involving contrary literals. It is natural that in fuzzy case
the contrariety of two literals is also fuzzy (the degree of incomparability).
Note that the contrariety and incomparability coincide only in two-valued
non-fuzzy case (classical propositional calculus); in any other case the
incomparability condition is weaker.

<P>The second factor influencing the adjacency of two disjuncts is a generalization
of the conventional condition which consists in the absence in disjuncts
of the second pair of contrary literals.

<P>When computing the value constant(<B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB> OR <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>)
we have to construct i-th section of the resolvent <B>w</B><SUB>i</SUB>=<B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB>OR<B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>,
i.e., in fact, to find out if two disjuncts are adjacent or not with the
help of this criterion it is necessary to construct n-1 sections of the
resolvent. Thus it could be more easy to construct the resolvent and then
to check if it is a consequence of one of its premises. However it is not
so, since for the majority of disjunct pairs the condition incomp(<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>,<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>)=0
holds, and therefore the criterion constant(<B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB> OR <B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>)&lt;incomp(<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>,<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>)
cannot be satisfied in any case. In addition, even if incomp(<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>,<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>)>0
it makes sense to check the criterion for each new section of the resolvent
rather than check the adjacency after building all the sections. Thus the
whole procedure for generating resolvents is as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
build the k-the section of the resolvent: <B>w</B><SUB>k</SUB>=<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>AND<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>;</LI>

<LI>
find the value incomp(<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>,<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>);</LI>

<LI>
if incomp(<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>,<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>)=0 then goto 9;</LI>

<LI>
for i=1,2,...,n (except for i=k);</LI>

<LI>
build the i-th section of the resolvent: <B>w</B><SUB>i</SUB>=<B>u</B><SUB>i</SUB>OR<B>v</B><SUB>i</SUB>;</LI>

<LI>
if constant(<B>w</B><SUB>i</SUB>)>=incomp(<B>u</B><SUB>k</SUB>,<B>v</B><SUB>k</SUB>)
then goto 9;</LI>

<LI>
next i (goto 5);</LI>

<LI>
the disjuncts <B>u</B> and <B>v</B> are adjacent and the resolvent <B>w</B>
is built;</LI>

<LI>
the disjuncts <B>u</B> and <B>v</B> are not adjacent;</LI>
</OL>

6.1. Finding Prime Disjuncts</H3>
The problem of finding prime disjuncts has the same significance as that
in the boolean case since once we have found prime disjuncts we can solve
many other problems. In this section we consider a method for generating
prime disjuncts which is based on the operation of fuzzy resolution.

<P>Prime disjuncts are always defined in relation to some fuzzy distribution
which is supposed to be represented by a fuzzy CNF. In other words, a disjunct
may be prime in relation to one fuzzy distribution and it may be not prime
in relation to another fuzzy distribution. Prime disjunct is a disjunct
which is a consequence of the corresponding fuzzy distribution but is not
a consequence of any other disjunct (among those which are a consequence
of this distribution). Thus prime disjunct is in a certain sense the most
strong disjunct among those which can represent the corresponding fuzzy
distribution, i.e., those which can be added to the CNF without the distribution
change. If a prime disjunct is in a reduced form then it can be shown that
if any its component is decreased then new disjunct is already not a consequence
of the corresponding distribution, i.e., no one component of a prime disjunct
in a reduced form can be decreased..

<P>The method of finding prime disjuncts based on the resolution operation
consists in applying the resolution to different disjuncts from the CNF
on different variables, adding the resolvents obtained to the CNF and absorbing
disjuncts which are a consequence of other disjuncts in this CNF. The process
is stopped when any new resolvent is absorbed, i.e., no new resolvent can
be generated. The main problem in this method is in which order to apply
the resolution. According to the breadth first approach the resolution
is applied to all disjunct pairs in the current CNF and new resolvents
are added to the end of this CNF but the resolution is not applied to them.
After the generation phase the process of absorption is carried out when
all disjuncts which are a consequence of any other are removed from the
CNF. After that new generation-absorption pass is started until no new
resolvents can be generated. Obviously, before generating each new resolvent
we check if two disjuncts are adjacent and if yes then after the resolvent
is built we check if it is not a consequence of some disjunct already in
the CNF. The whole process is shown in Fig. 7.

an input of the pass 2. During the pass 2 we generate only one disjunct
<B>7</B> -- other generated disjuncts are absorbed by the disjuncts which
are already in the matrix. For example, the resolvent <B>2</B>&lt;x<SUB>2</SUB>><B>5</B>

Each pair of disjuncts from this matrix generates a resolvent which is
absorbed by some other disjunct. So we cannot generate more disjuncts and
the process is stopped. Thus we obtained the final matrix <B>D</B><SUB>3</SUB>
which consists of 6 prime disjuncts.
<H3>
6.2. Transforming Matrix into the Dual Form</H3>
Let us consider only transformation of DNF into CNF. The back transformation
is carried out in the dual way. This problem is formulated as follows.
There is a sectioned matrix <B>C</B> consisting of fuzzy conjuncts and
representing a fuzzy DNF. It is necessary to transform it into the matrix
of disjuncts <B>D</B> interpreted as a CNF and characterized by the same
fuzzy distribution.

<P>This procedure is based on the operation of adding the conjunct <B>c</B>
to the disjunct <B>d</B> which results in the CNF <B>D</B>:
<CENTER>(<B>c</B><SUB>1</SUB> AND <B>c</B><SUB>2</SUB> AND ... AND <B>c</B><SUB>n</SUB>)
OR (<B>d</B><SUB>1</SUB> OR <B>d</B><SUB>2</SUB> OR ... OR <B>d</B><SUB>n</SUB>)
= <B>D</B></CENTER>


<P>It can be proved that this operation results in n disjuncts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>((<B>d</B><SUB>1</SUB> OR <B>c</B><SUB>1</SUB>) OR <B>d</B><SUB>2</SUB>
OR ... OR <B>d</B><SUB>n</SUB>) AND
<BR>(<B>d</B><SUB>1</SUB> OR (<B>d</B><SUB>2</SUB> OR <B>c</B><SUB>1</SUB>)

Thus to add the conjunct <B>c</B> to the disjunct <B>d</B> we have to copy

Obviously the first disjunct can be removed from the matrix since it is
absolutely valid (its constant is equal to 1).

<P>In general, before generating i-th disjunct <B>d</B><SUP>i</SUP> at
the i-th step it is natural to check if the section <B>c</B><SUB>i</SUB>
is present (i.e., it is not equal to the constant 1) and if the disjunction
<B>d</B><SUB>i</SUB> OR <B>c</B><SUB>i</SUB> is not valid.

<P>The procedure of transforming DNF into CNF is based on the operation
of adding a conjunct to a disjunct. At each step of this procedure we add
new conjunct from the DNF to all disjuncts from the CNF. At the beginning
we add the first conjunct from the DNF to the empty CNF which involves
only one disjunct consisting of all 0. The number of disjuncts in the matrix
<B>D</B> grows very quickly therefore it is necessary to carry out periodically
the procedure of absorption.

<P>For example, let us suppose that we have to transform the matrix of
DNF

and <B>c</B><SUP>3</SUP> into the matrix of CNF. The whole procedure consists
of 3 steps. At each step we add to the DNF one conjunct from <B>C</B>.
Thus at the first step we transform the conjunct <B>c</B><SUP>1</SUP> into
the matrix of DNF, i.e., we add this conjunct to the initial disjunct consisting
of all 0. This results in the matrix

<A NAME="7"></A>7. Finding Projections on Variables</H2>
The problem of finding projections on variables is one of the most important
in multi-dimensional analysis. With the help of this operation we obtain
a local distribution over the values of one variable from a multi-dimensional
distribution. Let us suppose that it is required to find a projection of
the distribution represented by the matrix of CNF <B>D</B> onto the variable
x<SUB>k</SUB>. Generally, projection can be defined in different ways but
we will suppose that it is defined by means of the operation of maximum.
Namely, j-th value of the projection on the variable x<SUB>k</SUB>, i.e.,
its value in the point a<SUB>kj</SUB> is equal to
<CENTER>max( <B>D</B>(x<SUB>1</SUB>,..., x<SUB>k</SUB>=a<SUB>kj</SUB>,...,
x<SUB>n</SUB>) )</CENTER>
on all values of all variables except for x<SUB>k</SUB>=a<SUB>kj</SUB>.
In other words, we take maximum in all points which have k-th component
(k-th dimension) equal to a<SUB>kj</SUB>. Thus to calculate the whole projection
in n<SUB>k</SUB> points of k-th domain&nbsp; we have to take maximum in
all point of the universe of discourse. Obviously, the maximum of the projection
on any variable is equal to the maximum of the whole multi-dimensional
distribution and therefore we can solve the satisfiability problem (finding
the consistency) by finding any projection.

<P>We can also redefine the projection by means of the logical consequence
relation. Let us suppose that n projections on all variables are represented
by the conjunct <B>c</B>, i.e., each section <B>c</B><SUB>i</SUB> of this
conjunct represents a projection on i-th variable. Then all its components
<B>c</B><SUB>ij</SUB> must be minimal provided that it is still a consequence
of <B>D</B>. In other words, to find the conjunct of projections <B>c</B>
we have to take the trivial conjunct consisting of all 1 and gradually
decrease its components untill we reach the border where it ceases to be
a consequence of <B>D</B>.

<P>One procedure for finding projections is based on a theorem [<A HREF="#S93a">S93a</A>]
which affirms that disjunct <B>u</B> is a consequence of the matrix of
CNF <B>D</B> iff there exists such a prime disjunct <B>p</B> of this matrix
that the disjunct <B>d</B> is its consequence:
<CENTER><B>D</B> |= <B>u</B> &lt;=> there exists prime <B>p</B>: <B>p</B>
|= <B>u</B></CENTER>


<P>With the help of this criterion we can check if some disjunct is a consequence
of the matrix, but we can also find minimal disjuncts which satisfy this
condition. It can shown that the projection on k-th variable of the distribution
represented by the matrix of CNF <B>D</B> is equal to the minimum of projections
of all prime disjuncts on this variable. Note that we have to have <I>all</I>
prime disjuncts to carry out this procedure.

<P>Projection on k-th variable of one disjunct is equal to the k-th section
of this disjunct plus constant M which is equal to maximal value in all
the rest of the sections (i.e., M is equal to the maximum of all non-k-th
section constants). For example, projection of the disjunct

on 3rd variable is equal to {0, 0.2, 0.7, 1}+0.4={0.4, 0.4, 0.7, 1} while
its projections on the variables x<SUB>1</SUB> and x<SUB>2</SUB> is equal
to the constant 1 (we say that the projection is absent).

<A NAME="8"></A>8. Conclusion</H2>
<I>Distribution as logical proposition</I>
<UL>The notion of fuzzy relation or fuzzy multi-dimensional distribution
which has been studied in the paper is certainly not new and has been paid
a lot of attention in fuzzy literature. On the other hand, one traditional
direction of fuzzy research has consisted in fuzzifying classical logics.
These two approaches have being developed in great extent independently.
Fuzzy relations are usually described in algebraic terms (e.g., as fuzzy
relational algebra) while fuzzy logics are usually obtained from some classical
logic by introducing fuzzy parameters (in fact, there are two big approaches
to fuzzifying classical logics: (i) fuzzifying interpretations (e.g., [<A HREF="#L71">L71</A>,
<A HREF="#L72">L72</A>]) and fuzzifying formulas themselves, e.g., introducing
weights to propositions (e.g., [<A HREF="#DLP91">DLP91</A>])). One general
result of this paper is that we have established a connection between these
two directions. Now we know that any local (fuzzy) distribution can be
viewed as a proposition in logical sense and we can combine them just as
ordinary propositions by means of connections AND and OR to build more
complex propositions [<A HREF="#S93b">S93b</A>], particularly, fuzzy CNF
and fuzzy DNF. Of course, it is not enough to declare that the distribution
(relation) is a proposition and in the paper we have shown that the whole
behavior of our formal system is analogous to and even more general then
that of the propositional logic.</UL>
<I>Inference as equivalent transformation</I>
<UL>Traditionally logical inference has been thought of as applying inference
rules to axioms and theorems which have been already proved and obtaining
new theorems (deduction process). As a result we could infer logical statements
which express in an explicit form different properties of the formal system
hidden in the original representation by means of axioms. Although we have
showed in the paper that our approach to logical inference is analogous
to this one, we also give another interpretation for it. According to this
view inference process is considered as an equivalent transformation of
our representation of the semantics by means of axioms to some other representation
which is more appropriate in the sense of explicit representation of necessary
properties. In this case a consequence relation is only one of many possible
equivalent transformations which allows us to remove unnecessary statements.
This interpretation of logical inference seems more general especially
when considering non-minimax operations for composing distributions.</UL>
<I>Values of variables and values of distributions</I>
<UL>One general result of the approach described in the paper is that we
clearly distinguish two notions of values of variables and values of distributions
which are often mixed in traditional formalisms. The values of individual
logical variables can be associated with the syntax or objective part of
the problem domain. They define the matter of propositions, i.e., what
the proposition is about, e.g., it can be some states space. On the other
hand, the values of distributions are associated with the semantics or
subjective part of the problem domain. They define the proposition itself,
e.g., what we think or know about the possible states. However in the case
of superpositions the same set of values can represent both syntactic and
semantic values. For example, when we negate some proposition we in essence
apply the proposition (negation) to the set of values which are semantical
for the negated proposition but syntactic for the negation.</UL>
<I>Inference as finding projections</I>
<UL>Suppose we know that inference process is an equivalent transformation
of our representation to some form, i.e., to infer something we have to
change the form of representation in such a way that the semantics remain
the same. Then the question arises: What form of representation we have
to seek for, and why it is better than other forms, i.e., what is the goal
of inference process? An answer is the following. Our general goal is to
reveal interesting in some sense (global) properties of a multi-dimensional
distribution, i.e., to find the form of representation where these properties
would be explicit. Usually explicit form of representation assumes that
the property is expressed in one statement. The property which is looked
for in most cases is the projection of the whole distribution on some variable(s)
or the proposition about one variable. Although there may be also other
properties (e.g., correlations between individual variables) this one is
supposed the most important and is considered to be the goal of general
inference process.</UL>
<I>Fuzzy resolution operation and its properties</I>
<UL>Perhaps the most important result described in the paper is new fuzzy
resolution operation. It generalizes traditional consensus operation and
resolution in logic in two directions: (i) values of variables are supposed
to be many-valued [<A HREF="#Zk89">Zk89</A>] and even continuos, and (ii)
distributions are supposed to take values from the interval [0,1] [<A HREF="#S91">S91</A>].
The criterion of adjacency formulated in the paper enforces the analogy
with crisp case since it allows us to determine when the resolvent is not
trivial. To define correctly the resolution operation and the criterion
of adjacency we had to introduce such new notions as reduced forms, degree
of incomparability, constant of disjunct.</UL>
<I>Negation as proposition</I>
<UL>Although it is not described in this paper, it can be easily shown
that we do not need an operation of negation. Instead of it we can use
more general operation of superposition (proposition about proposition),
a particular case of which represents negation. More about this can be
read in [<A HREF="#S93b">S93b</A>].</UL>
